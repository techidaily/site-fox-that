However, there are two more methods you can use to restart your iPhone, and they don’t involve using any buttons.</p><p> This comes in handy if your iPhone buttons are broken or not working for any reason. It can also be helpful if you’re unable to press and hold the buttons.</p><h3 id="How-to-Restart-an-iPhone-From-the-Settings-App"><a href="#How-to-Restart-an-iPhone-From-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Restart an iPhone From the Settings App"></a>How to Restart an iPhone From the Settings App</h3><p> The first method is to restart your iPhone through the<strong>Settings</strong> app. Follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>General</strong> and tap<strong>Shut Down</strong> .</li><li>Drag the power off slider to the right to turn off your iPhone.</li><li>Wait for at least 30 seconds.</li><li>Finally, to turn on your iPhone, plug it in to charge.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iphone-settings-app-showing-general-option.png"                      alt="iPhone Settings app showing General option"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iphone-settings-app-showing-shut-down.png"                      alt="iPhone Settings app showing Shut Down"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FWCFI3f_cs?si=Kt2Onr_E4c616tbH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iphone-power-off-screen.png"                      alt="iPhone Power off screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=lhdUUVYMVQjzHXBh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h3 id="How-to-Restart-an-iPhone-Using-Siri"><a href="#How-to-Restart-an-iPhone-Using-Siri" class="headerlink" title="How to Restart an iPhone Using Siri"></a>How to Restart an iPhone Using Siri</h3><p> The second button-free method involves using Siri, the virtual assistant on your iPhone. However, this method requires an iPhone running iOS 16 or later. To use Siri to restart your device, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>First,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-and-use-siri-iphone/" >set up Siri on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Ensure that you have<strong>Listen for “Hey Siri”</strong> toggled on and that your iPhone is connected to the internet.</li><li>Say to your device clearly, “Hey Siri, restart my iPhone.”</li><li>You’ll see a pop-up on your screen. Tap<strong>Restart</strong> to confirm. Your iPhone will now turn off and turn on again all by itself.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/muo-in-article-image-1200px-by-600px-21-ratio-23.jpg"                      alt="using siri to restart iphone"                ></p><h2 id="How-Often-Should-You-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#How-Often-Should-You-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How Often Should You Restart Your iPhone?"></a>How Often Should You Restart Your iPhone?</h2><p> The opinion on this varies from person to person. Some people don’t restart their devices for weeks, while others frequently restart them. Most users perform a restart when their <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-slow-iphone/" >iPhone feels slow <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , their <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-ios-apps-keep-crashing-try-fixes/" >iPhone apps keep crashing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and the overall performance feels sluggish.</p><p> For the best iPhone experience, you should restart your iPhone at least once every week. If you do it every three days, that’s even better. This gives the device a chance to shut down and cool off. Plus, temporary files are cleared, minor issues are fixed automatically, and you’ll probably face fewer situations where you need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-force-stop-apps-on-your-phone/" >force stop apps on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Force-Restart-When-a-Normal-Restart-Doesn’t-Work"><a href="#Force-Restart-When-a-Normal-Restart-Doesn’t-Work" class="headerlink" title="Force Restart When a Normal Restart Doesn’t Work"></a>Force Restart When a Normal Restart Doesn’t Work</h2><p> This is how you can restart any iPhone. As you saw, the process is quick and straightforward. However, if your device is frozen, the screen is black, stuck indefinitely on the Apple logo, or the touch screen isn’t working, a simple restart may not work.</p><p> In these situations, consider force restarting your iPhone. The steps to force restart are different but still easy. Doing this may help fix your iPhone and get out of any ongoing trouble.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-mastering-digital-art-the-ultimate-2024-picsart-review/"><u>[New] Mastering Digital Art The Ultimate 2024 PicsArt Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-converting-video-content-from-twitter-to-an-audiophile-written-mp3-format/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Converting Video Content From Twitter to an Audiophile' Written MP3 Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/best-10-shopping-sites-to-customize-your-gift-boxes-for-2024/"><u>Best 10 Shopping Sites to Customize Your Gift Boxes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/brighten-up-solutions-for-reactivating-your-iphones-icloud-features/"><u>Brighten Up: Solutions for Reactivating Your iPhone's iCloud Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/how-did-netflix-transition-from-dvd-rentals-to-an-exclusive-streaming-service/"><u>How Did Netflix Transition From DVD Rentals to an Exclusive Streaming Service?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-opening-of-srt-on-computers/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Opening of SRT on Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-gamer-xtreme-by-cyberpowerpc-the-smart-choice-for-cost-conscious-gamers-seeking-flexibility/"><u>In-Depth Look at the Gamer Xtreme by CyberPowerPC: The Smart Choice for Cost-Conscious Gamers Seeking Flexibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/iphone-facial-recognition-issues-resolved-discover-14-effective-remedies-for-an-unresponsive-face-id/"><u>IPhone Facial Recognition Issues Resolved: Discover 14 Effective Remedies for an Unresponsive Face ID</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721478764407-lost-all-iconography-on-ios-device-heres-how-to-restore-them/"><u>Lost All Iconography on iOS Device?

Quickly Improve Speed Using These 10 Tips"></a>Frustrated with Sluggish Mobile Data? Quickly Improve Speed Using These 10 Tips</h2><p> Wondering why your cellular data is so slow? Working with a slow data connection on your phone is extremely frustrating, whether you have an iPhone or Android device. When you’re trying to watch a video or look up information, it’s easy to get upset when service doesn’t meet the standard you expect.</p><p> In most cases, a slow data connection is temporary as it’s caused by your location or network congestion. But at other times, it can persist for hours or even days. Before you call your mobile carrier’s technical support, try these simple steps first and see if they fix your slow mobile data issues.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-Phone"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your Phone"></a>1. Restart Your Phone</h2><p> This seems like a cliché fix, but it often works. Restarting your phone should fix sluggish cellular data speeds, especially if you haven’t turned it off in a while. If you’re in a rush, you can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-airplane-mode/" >putting your phone in airplane mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first. But a full restart is always a good idea.</p><p>Restarting your phone is simple. Follow these steps for your device:</p><ul><li>On an iPhone without a Home button, press and hold the<strong>side button</strong> , plus either the<strong>Volume Up</strong> or<strong>Volume Down</strong> button, until<strong>Slide to Power Off</strong> appears. After you power off your iPhone, hold the<strong>side button</strong> again to turn it back on.</li><li>If you have an iPhone with a Home button, simply hold the<strong>side button</strong> (usually on the right side of the phone, or the top of older devices) until<strong>Slide to Power Off</strong> appears on the screen.</li><li>For most Android phones, you just need to hold the<strong>Power</strong> button until the power options appear on the screen, then tap<strong>Restart</strong> . If you don’t see<strong>Restart</strong> , choose<strong>Power off</strong> , then hold<strong>Power</strong> again to boot your phone back up.</li></ul><p> No matter your device, it’s a good idea to leave your phone turned off for a few minutes before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS-power-off-1.png"                      alt="iOS Power Off menu"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Android-Power-Off-Menu-2.jpg"                      alt="Android Power Off Menu"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="2-Move-to-a-Different-Location"><a href="#2-Move-to-a-Different-Location" class="headerlink" title="2. Move to a Different Location"></a>2. Move to a Different Location</h2><p> Many physical factors can result in slow LTE or 5G. These include weather, network congestion, and even solar activity. But chief among these are geography and buildings.</p><p> If you’re in a remote area, or there are a lot of natural barriers around you (such as hills, mountains, and valleys), you’ll probably experience a poor signal. Try to move to a more even-leveled location if the landscape around you fits one of these extremes.</p><p> The same goes for being inside buildings. You might be in the middle of a heavily populated urban area with full bars on your device, then wonder why your data becomes so slow when you enter certain structures. Being underground, or surrounded by concrete in a structure like a basement, can negatively affect your data signal.</p><p> If you’re having data speed problems that only started in a certain location, try moving somewhere else. You may need to leave the building you’re in or drive a few miles away. While this may not be convenient, it’s a good way to troubleshoot your speed issue.</p><p> This step is likely something tech support will ask you to do anyway if you call for help. Unfortunately, current network technology doesn’t provide perfect coverage in all areas, so location is still a big factor. As 5G continues to become more popular, we’ll hopefully see fewer dead zones.</p><h2 id="3-Update-and-Disable-Network-Heavy-Apps"><a href="#3-Update-and-Disable-Network-Heavy-Apps" class="headerlink" title="3. Update and Disable Network-Heavy Apps"></a>3. Update and Disable Network-Heavy Apps</h2><p> Sometimes a troublesome app can cause issues by hogging your data connection, thus leaving less bandwidth for other apps and slowing everything down. In such a case, you’ll need to do a little investigating to see what, if anything, is eating into your bandwidth. If there is something amiss, you can disable the app’s access to your cellular data connection or uninstall it.</p><p> When your iPhone internet is slow, you can visit<strong>Settings &gt; Cellular</strong> and use the list to disable any app’s access to your cellular data connection.</p><p> On Android, you’ll find this at<strong>Settings &gt; Network &amp; internet &gt; Mobile network</strong> (<strong>SIMs</strong> on Android 12)<strong>&gt; App data usage</strong> . Tap an app, then slide the<strong>Background data</strong> slider off to prevent that app from using data in the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01b-iPhone-YouTube-Check-Data-Usage.png"                      alt="iPhone YouTube Check Data Usage"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ECz3oZ8NrQ?si=86vkwkDJo9HQXpzt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screenshot_20220218-152746.png"                      alt="Android Screenshot Data Usage"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> You should also check for app updates. App developers publish updates to address bugs all the time, which could include fixes for slow network performance or excessive bandwidth usage.</p><p> See <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >how to update apps on iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/downloading-apps-android-everything-need-know/" >how to update your Android apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you need help.</p><h2 id="4-Disable-Data-Saver-or-Low-Data-Mode"><a href="#4-Disable-Data-Saver-or-Low-Data-Mode" class="headerlink" title="4. Disable Data Saver or Low Data Mode"></a>4. Disable Data Saver or Low Data Mode</h2><p> Both Android and iPhone contain modes designed to reduce your data usage. These are handy if you have a limited amount of data, but if you enabled them by accident, they can make it seem like your mobile connection is slower than it actually is. Try disabling these modes to see if everything feels faster.</p><p> On Android, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Network &amp; internet &gt; Data Saver</strong> . If you have an iPhone, you’ll find a comparable setting called<strong>Low Data Mode</strong> under <strong>Settings &gt; Cellular &gt; Cellular Data Options &gt; Data Mode</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cellular-low-data-mode-active.jpeg"                      alt="Cellular settings with Low Data Mode active."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eu4vwlZcMvM?si=4vEczfVU4BUUFP-t" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/01b-Android-Data-Saver.png"                      alt="Android Data Saver"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKZUYice-ws?si=L8iMa9T3h7TMSWdQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> If you’re worried about how much data you use, make sure you turn these back on after a bit. You should be able to tell if this setting is making your mobile data slower or not. It cuts a few corners, such as not loading images until you tap them, or pausing background sync until you open an app.</p><h2 id="5-Remember-Your-Data-Cap"><a href="#5-Remember-Your-Data-Cap" class="headerlink" title="5. Remember Your Data Cap"></a>5. Remember Your Data Cap</h2><p> Don’t forget that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/data-caps-exist-can-bypass/" >you probably have a mobile data cap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ranging from a few to several dozen gigabytes. If you go over that cap, your mobile carrier will usually slow your connection (in lieu of expensive overages).</p><p> Even those on so-called “unlimited” plans will usually experience throttling or “deprioritization” during times of network congestion, especially after they hit a certain limit. This might be the cause when you experience slow mobile internet. If you’ve used up your allotment, you’ll either have to wait until your bill cycle resets or purchase additional high-speed data.</p><p> It’s a good idea to know how much data you can use before your carrier drops you down to a much slower connection speed. If you’re not sure, check your account through the company’s mobile app or website. That will show how much high-speed data you have per month, and how much you’ve used so far.</p><p> Then, use our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/save-money-mobile-internet-data-bill-apps-tricks/" >tips for reducing your mobile data usage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you need to cut back on data consumption.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YezPJZzPJ8Q?si=xF1t4BQHFquzvnzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Disconnect-From-Your-VPN"><a href="#6-Disconnect-From-Your-VPN" class="headerlink" title="6. Disconnect From Your VPN"></a>6. Disconnect From Your VPN</h2><p> VPNs can provide additional privacy and let you get around geo-restrictions, but staying connected to a VPN can also slow down your mobile speeds due to increased overhead. Thus, if your phone is connected to a VPN and you need to make your data faster, try disconnecting from the VPN first.</p><p> Chances are, you’ll notice an immediate improvement as soon as you disconnect. If that does fix the problem, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/useful-tips-vpn-speed-slow/" >improve your VPN’s speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when you reconnect to it.</p><p> Not using a VPN yet? We highly recommend <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkev.com/order?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=makeuseof" >ExpressVPN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because it’s effective and reputable.

Check for Network Outages"></a>7. Check for Network Outages</h2><p> Though mobile carriers love to boast about their reliability, outages happen all the time. These outages often account for reduced speeds or even lost connections. If you’re still experiencing slow mobile data after checking all the above, it’s a good idea to check for outages with your carrier before calling in.</p><p> If you can connect to Wi-Fi, it’s possible to do some investigating. Try checking a website such as <a class="link"   href="https://downdetector.com/" >Downdetector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Often, if the issue is widespread, other people will have already reported it. You’ll see a large spike in recent reports about outages with your carrier, and can check the heatmap to see which areas of the country are experiencing problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Down-Detector-Verizon-2021.png"                      alt="Down Detector Verizon 2021"                ></p><p> You can also hop onto social media. Twitter is a good place to research connection issues because people will often tweet about their connection problems. Plus, if you contact your mobile carrier’s support Twitter account, you’re likely to get a response quickly.</p><p> This also lets you do something else while you wait, instead of wasting time on hold while calling your carrier’s support number.</p><h2 id="8-Reset-Your-Phone’s-Network-Settings"><a href="#8-Reset-Your-Phone’s-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="8. Reset Your Phone’s Network Settings"></a>8. Reset Your Phone’s Network Settings</h2><p> Resetting your network settings often fixes a slow mobile data connection, but it’s a more drastic step. Doing this resets everything related to networking to its default. This includes removing your Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth devices, and similar. Losing these isn’t the end of the world, but you will have to reconnect to saved Wi-Fi networks and re-pair your Bluetooth devices later.</p><p> To reset network settings on an iPhone, open <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings</strong> . Your phone will prompt you for your passcode if you have one, then it will restart to perform the operation.</p><p> On an Android phone, you’ll find the reset network settings option at <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Advanced &gt; Reset options &gt; Reset Wi-Fi, mobile &amp; Bluetooth</strong> . This may be in a different location depending on your phone manufacturer and Android version. Try searching for “reset” in the Settings search bar if you can’t find it.</p><p> Resetting the network settings on an Android phone usually does not require you to restart the device. However, it’s not a bad idea to restart anyway.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-Transfer-or-Factory-Reset.PNG"                      alt="iPhone Transfer or Factory Reset"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dn-24B6AURY?si=ErES2KWVnintY6h9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/android-factory-reset-options.jpg"                      alt="android factory reset options"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1yHj02oP3w?si=mwi3FyP0p68gkBqV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Remove-and-Reinsert-Your-SIM-Card"><a href="#9-Remove-and-Reinsert-Your-SIM-Card" class="headerlink" title="9. Remove and Reinsert Your SIM Card"></a>9. Remove and Reinsert Your SIM Card</h2><p> Finally, you can try to pull out, then reinsert, your SIM card. This can clear up any underlying issues affecting your phone’s connection to your carrier.</p><p> Where your SIM card is located varies from device to device. On older iPhones, the SIM card slot is located on the right edge of the phone, below the side button. The iPhone 12 and 13 series have the SIM slot on the left side of the device.</p><p> On Android devices, it can be on the side, top, bottom, or even behind the back cover if your phone has a removable battery. Google your phone model, or check the manual, if you can’t locate it.</p><p> The SIM sits in a small tray that will pop out. You can pull some SIM trays with your fingernail. Others may require you to use a small tool, usually provided in the phone box. If you don’t have this handy, you can bend a paper clip or use the back of an earring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/800px-IPhone_sim_slot.jpg"                      alt="Paper clip ejecting SIM card from an iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAzTErKy6h8?si=vi5z3M9_7fW6qiAJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit: Calerusnak&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IPhone%5Fsim%5Fslot.jpg" >Wikimedia Commons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Before pulling your SIM card, you should ideally turn off your phone. It’s not a huge deal, but will prevent any potential damage. Also, make sure you pull your SIM while sitting at a table or other flat surface, since it’s tiny and easy to lose. You don’t want to drop it into the grass.</p><p> If pulling the SIM card doesn’t work, you can try replacing it. This will require going into one of your carrier’s store locations, so you should call first if your issue still isn’t resolved at this point. Your carrier may send you a new SIM through the mail anyway.</p><p> Keep in mind that if you have an older phone, you may not be able to access the fastest mobile data standards. See <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/lte-vs-4g-vs-5g-whats-difference/" >our comparison of 4G LTE and 5G <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for what to expect. 5G is the newest and fastest data type, but LTE should be enough to do almost anything you enjoy.</p><h2 id="10-Call-Your-Carrier’s-Support"><a href="#10-Call-Your-Carrier’s-Support" class="headerlink" title="10. Call Your Carrier’s Support"></a>10. Call Your Carrier’s Support</h2><p> If none of these steps fix your slow data, then it’s time to call tech support. Contact your mobile carrier through its support number, which you can find through the mobile app or with a quick Google search.</p><p> Keep in mind that the technician on the phone may have you repeat some of these steps. You might want to refuse because you’re already done them, but it’s the employee’s job to go through a list of troubleshooting steps to see what works and what doesn’t.</p><p> You can try explaining upfront what you’ve already done, but it’s worth sticking with their instructions to make sure you didn’t miss anything.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-My-Phone-Internet-Slow-Now-You-Know"><a href="#Why-Is-My-Phone-Internet-Slow-Now-You-Know" class="headerlink" title="Why Is My Phone Internet Slow? Now You Know"></a>Why Is My Phone Internet Slow? Now You Know</h2><p> Hopefully, you can make your mobile data faster without having to call your carrier. But if nothing above does the job, the issue could be something on your provider’s end that you can’t fix. That’s why it’s a good idea to call if you’re out of other options.</p><p> Remember that a slow data connection is only part of a potential problem. If your phone is still slow on Wi-Fi, you’ll need to investigate further to improve Wi-Fi performance too.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-crystalvision-pro-screen-capturing-101/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved CrystalVision Pro Screen Capturing 101</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-easing-into-public-speaking-10-common-video-blogger-fears/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Easing Into Public Speaking 10 Common Video Blogger Fears</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-leading-7-video-streaming-apps-to-enhance-your-youtube-mobile-experience/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Leading 7 Video Streaming Apps to Enhance Your YouTube Mobile Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-online-marketplaces-for-yt-channel-sales/"><u>[Updated] Navigating Online Marketplaces for YT Channel Sales</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-extensive-review-the-gecata-gamersoft-toolkit/"><u>2024 Approved Extensive Review The Gecata Gamersoft Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/cross-platform-content-transfer-youtube-meets-facebook/"><u>Cross-Platform Content Transfer YouTube Meets Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-adjust-your-iphone-settings-when-random-websites-show-up-in-screen-time/"><u>How to Adjust Your iPhone Settings When Random Websites Show Up in Screen Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/ipad-reset-protocols-how-to-successfully-engage-recovery-mode/"><u>IPad Reset Protocols: How to Successfully Engage Recovery Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/iphone-losing-cell-connection-discover-these-10-quick-fixes/"><u>IPhone Losing Cell Connection?

Nowadays, you can just turn to the multi-functional iPhone you have in your hand. That is, provided your iPhone’s flashlight is working.</p><p> It’s a massive hindrance when your iPhone’s flashlight stops working and you see a grayed-out flashlight icon. So, let’s look at the various solutions you can try to get your iPhone torch working again.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><h2 id="1-Turn-Off-Low-Power-Mode"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Low-Power-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1.

When it’s activated, the color of your battery level appears yellow instead of green.</p><p> The Low Power Mode prompt automatically comes up when your battery percentage falls below 20 percent. If you want to save battery life, you may also choose to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-permanently-turn-on-low-power-mode-iphone/" >keep your iPhone in Low Power Mode all the time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> But your iPhone’s flashlight is often one of those features that get disabled by this mode. To turn off Low Power Mode, go to the<strong>Settings</strong> app, select<strong>Battery</strong> , and tap to toggle off<strong>Low Power Mode</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-1.JPG"                      alt="iphone settings app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHWdQw1gRyI?si=ve9wZnPupiooLThG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-2.JPG"                      alt="turn off low power mode in iphone settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="2-Charge-Your-iPhone"><a href="#2-Charge-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="2.

This may be simply because your device doesn’t have enough battery power left to support the feature at that moment. Therefore, you should plug your iPhone into a power source and start charging it.</p><p> The flashlight feature should start working again once your iPhone has sufficient power.</p><h2 id="3-Check-Your-iPhone-Isn’t-Too-Hot"><a href="#3-Check-Your-iPhone-Isn’t-Too-Hot" class="headerlink" title="3. Check Your iPhone Isn’t Too Hot"></a>3. Check Your iPhone Isn’t Too Hot</h2><p> When your iPhone gets too hot, the flashlight may stop working. It’s not advisable to continue using an overheating iPhone. If your device exceeds a particular temperature limit, it will eventually shut down until it cools off. You’ll also see a warning appear on your screen if the temperature gets too high.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blue-iphone-pro.jpg"                      alt="blue iphone pro on white surface"                ></p><p> To allow your device’s temperature to drop naturally, place your iPhone in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Do not attempt to put your device into the fridge, though, as this will cause damage to it. Just find somewhere that’s naturally cool and shady. Once your device cools down, your iPhone’s flashlight should start working again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rCjQ09iG7s?si=Si1fUBric8MH1VHI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Remove-the-Flashlight-From-the-Control-Center"><a href="#4-Remove-the-Flashlight-From-the-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="4.

Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</h2><p> If your iPhone’s torch still isn’t working, another potential fix is to remove the flashlight option from the Control Center and then add it back again. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Go to the<strong>Settings</strong> app. Select<strong>Control Center</strong> .</li><li>Under<strong>Included Controls</strong> , tap the red<strong>minus (–)</strong> icon for<strong>Flashlight</strong> (or<strong>Torch</strong> , in some regions). Tap<strong>Remove</strong> to confirm.</li><li>To add the flashlight back, scroll down to the<strong>More Controls</strong> section.</li><li>Tap the<strong>plus (+)</strong> icon for<strong>Flashlight</strong> (or<strong>Torch</strong>).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-1.JPG"                      alt="iphone settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-3.JPG"                      alt="customize iphone control center"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-4.JPG"                      alt="customize iphone control center"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-Close-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App"><a href="#5-Close-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="5. Close Your iPhone’s Camera App"></a>5. Close Your iPhone’s Camera App</h2><p> Your iPhone’s camera’s flash function uses the same light as the flashlight. If you have the<strong>Camera</strong> app opened, it’s normal to see the Control Center’s flashlight icon grayed out. This is because you can’t use both features at the same time.</p><p> To solve this, just exit the<strong>Camera</strong> app and access your<strong>Control Center</strong> again. You should see that the flashlight button can once more be selected as usual.</p><h2 id="6-Turn-On-Your-Flashlight-Using-the-Camera-Flash"><a href="#6-Turn-On-Your-Flashlight-Using-the-Camera-Flash" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn On Your Flashlight Using the Camera Flash"></a>6. Turn On Your Flashlight Using the Camera Flash</h2><p> If you can’t turn on your iPhone’s flashlight from the Control Center, a workaround is to turn it on in the<strong>Camera</strong> app by activating the flash function. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>In the<strong>Camera</strong> app, go to<strong>Video</strong> mode.</li><li>Swipe up from the bottom menu (on the word,<strong>Video</strong>) to bring up more options.</li><li>Tap the<strong>Flash</strong> icon. Select<strong>On</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/video-mode-1.JPG"                      alt="iphone camera video mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/video-mode-2.JPG"                      alt="iphone camera video mode options"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/video-mode-3.JPG"                      alt="turn on iphone camera flash"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="7-Toggle-the-Flash-in-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App"><a href="#7-Toggle-the-Flash-in-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="7.

Toggle the Flash in Your iPhone’s Camera App</h2><p> To get rid of glitches that stop your iPhone’s flashlight from working, you can also try turning your camera flash on and off. The steps are the same as the workaround to turn on your iPhone’s camera flash, as discussed in the previous solution. But instead of leaving the<strong>Flash</strong> set to<strong>On</strong> , toggle between<strong>On</strong> and<strong>Off</strong> a few times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTHQrw8e1gk?si=gTPIa7KjhSZ0Vz97" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Ask-Siri-to-Turn-On-Your-iPhone’s-Flashlight"><a href="#8-Ask-Siri-to-Turn-On-Your-iPhone’s-Flashlight" class="headerlink" title="8.

Ask Siri to Turn On Your iPhone’s Flashlight</h2><p> If your camera flash doesn’t seem to be working either, there’s another way to enable your iPhone’s flashlight: Siri. Unless your device is absolutely low on battery, Siri can help you turn on your iPhone’s flashlight even if the icon is grayed out.</p><p> First,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-and-use-siri-iphone/" >set up Siri on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Next, long-press the Side button on your iPhone or say, “Hey Siri.” When the<strong>Siri</strong> icon pops up on your iPhone screen, say, “Turn on the flashlight.” Your flashlight should turn on instantly, and Siri will also say that it’s on now.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_7829.JPEG"                      alt="siri icon on iphone screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CdWd06fCwc?si=wzg-68q0jAksPRXp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_7830.JPEG"                      alt="siri response after turning on iphone flashlight"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EKBEujWCw4?si=PwVvvervi8OrYaEA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vfq0vw0Spz8?si=2EAk6hW-Gb-o33_L" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Update-Your-iPhone’s-iOS"><a href="#9-Update-Your-iPhone’s-iOS" class="headerlink" title="9.

So, perhaps all you need to do to fix your iPhone’s flashlight is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >update your iPhone to the latest version of iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> to see if an update is available for your iPhone.

Restart Your iPhone"></a>10. Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> If the above methods don’t solve the problem and your iPhone’s flashlight still isn’t working, the next step you should try is <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restarting your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-hello-screen-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone on wooden surface showing hello welcome screen"                ></p><p> The method you need to follow varies depending on the iPhone model you have. But in general, you can go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Shut Down &gt; Slide to power off</strong> . Then, hold the<strong>Side</strong> button to restart your iPhone once it powers off.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPCr_bxZjMQ?si=ubOsoq5umPEXL9xL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="11-Restore-Your-iPhone-to-a-Previous-Backup"><a href="#11-Restore-Your-iPhone-to-a-Previous-Backup" class="headerlink" title="11.

Tap<strong>Reset</strong> and choose<strong>Reset All Settings</strong> from the pop-up menu. You won’t lose any data from your iPhone; all this does is revert your iPhone’s settings to factory default values.</p><p> Take note that the reset process can take a long time, especially if you have a lot of data on your iPhone. So, if you’re stuck in the dark and urgently need a flashlight, don’t rely on resetting your iPhone right there and then!</p><p> Make sure you don’t accidentally choose<strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> from the<strong>Reset</strong> menu.

Usually, there are good reasons for it, like the auto-brightness, True Tone, Night Shift, and battery-saving features.</p><p> However, there can be serious hardware issues causing the iPhone screen to dim, like overheating. Below, we’ll look at why your iPhone’s screen automatically dims even at full brightness, how you can toggle features to stop it, and whether it’s worth making those changes or not.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Auto-Brightness"><a href="#1-Auto-Brightness" class="headerlink" title="1. Auto-Brightness"></a>1. Auto-Brightness</h2><p> In most cases, the auto-brightness feature causes the automatic screen dimming on your iPhone. It adjusts the screen brightness according to your surrounding light conditions with the help of the ambient light sensor installed near the iPhone’s front-facing camera.</p><p> This is why the screen becomes brighter when you’re outside, yet when you’re in the dark, it dims down to save power and avoid eye strain.</p><p> Although enabled by default, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-auto-brightness-iphone/" >disable auto-brightness on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . To do this, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size</strong> , scroll to the bottom, and turn off<strong>Auto-Brightness</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/display-and-text-size-accessibility-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Display &amp; Text Size option from iPhone Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/auto-brightness-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Auto-Brightness Feature in iPhone Settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="2-True-Tone"><a href="#2-True-Tone" class="headerlink" title="2. True Tone"></a>2. True Tone</h2><p> Your surrounding’s light also affects the colors. For instance, in warm lights, colors appear more yellow. To fight this and ensure all-time color accuracy, Apple added the True Tone feature to the iPhone, which adjusts screen colors according to your surrounding lights using sensors.</p><p> Although an excellent feature that is enabled by default, it can make your screen appear dim (or less saturated) in certain lighting. So, turning it off might solve your dimming problem and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-screen-yellow-tint-fixes/" >fix your iPhone screen’s yellow tint <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

The feature basically adds an overlay to your display, making it appear warmer.</p><p> Night Shift can make the screen appear dim as well. And since it’s usually scheduled to automatically turn on after sunset, the screen dimming effect can seem automatic. You can avoid this by either <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reduce-blue-light-on-your-iphone/" >keeping Night Shift on at all times to reduce blue light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or turning it off completely from<strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Night Shift</strong> .</p><h2 id="4-Auto-Lock"><a href="#4-Auto-Lock" class="headerlink" title="4. Auto-Lock"></a>4. Auto-Lock</h2><p> The<strong>Auto-Lock</strong> feature can be a probable cause of your iPhone’s randomly dimming screen, too. It’s designed to lock your iPhone automatically after a set period of inactivity—like 30 seconds—to prevent other people from accessing it.</p><p> So, when only a few seconds of inactivity remain, the screen will dim (indicating that the phone is about to lock itself). And, once the full period is over, the iPhone will lock itself.</p><p> However, if your set duration is too short, your screen will often dim—which can be random. Go to<strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Auto-Lock</strong> to change the duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/auto-lock-iphone.jpg"                      alt="auto-lock-iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/auto-lock-duration-iphone.jpg"                      alt="List of Auto-Lock duration presets"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0XhU5H8R4?si=cFPk6XK3X3CQSI7Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> The longer the set duration to prevent your iPhone screen from going dark, the more your battery will be used, which will be counterproductive if you need to extend battery life.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVsiIO7hWOc?si=UvWnqxaI_yHwEr74" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Dark-Mode"><a href="#5-Dark-Mode" class="headerlink" title="5.

Although Dark Mode doesn’t affect the iPhone’s brightness, it can make it appear dimmer.</p><p> You can try turning it off from<strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness</strong> . Alternatively, you can schedule it for nighttime, along with the Night Shift feature. This will help you keep your screen bright and vibrant throughout the day while intentionally darkening it at night.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmTJlcwgyrQ?si=x3hba82M0tT57fj7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Attention-Aware-Features"><a href="#6-Attention-Aware-Features" class="headerlink" title="6. Attention Aware Features"></a>6. Attention Aware Features</h2><p> Apple uses the Face ID sensors on the iPhone to enable Attention Aware features, which dims the screen if you’re not looking at it.</p><p> The Auto-Lock and Attention Aware features work together. If you’ve set your Auto-Lock to one minute, the iPhone will lock itself when it hasn’t had your attention for that time. But if you look at the screen, even if you haven’t touched it, Attention Aware will understand that you’re still looking and won’t lock your iPhone even after the set period has passed.</p><p> Therefore, if the feature is turned off, it can cause the screen to dim randomly, even when you’re looking at it as the iPhone prepares to lock itself. You can turn it on by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode &gt; Attention Aware Features</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/face-id-and-passcode-iphone-settings.jpg"                      alt="Face ID and Passcode Settings in iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMEJvwMM0vk?si=EQF_jo_4u9v5iJ_C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/enter-passcode-iphone-settings.jpg"                      alt="Passcode required to enter Passcode settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/attention-aware-iphone-feature.jpg"                      alt="Attention Aware Features in iPhone"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Doing this will likely fix the problem of your randomly dimming iPhone screen when Auto-Lock is enabled.</p><h2 id="7-Low-Power-Mode"><a href="#7-Low-Power-Mode" class="headerlink" title="7. Low Power Mode"></a>7. Low Power Mode</h2><p> The iPhone’s Low Power Mode is a setting that reduces background activity to save power and make your phone last longer.</p><p> This feature affects everything from email fetching to visual effects, like the Auto-Lock feature and screen brightness. Hence, this can be another reason why your iPhone is dimming randomly.</p><p> To turn this feature off, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Battery</strong> and toggle<strong>Low Power Mode</strong> .

Overheating"></a>8. Overheating</h2><p> Overheating is when your iPhone shows a black screen saying that the “iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it,” because its temperature has exceeded the safe range.</p><p> Following this message, the iPhone takes measures to reduce its temperature, like using less battery and RAM. This can lead to automatic screen dimming and an overall slower iPhone.</p><p> For more information, check out our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-ipad-getting-hot-heres-fix/" >iPhone overheating guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , where we’ve covered why the phone gets hot and how you can fix it.</p><h2 id="9-Reduce-White-Point"><a href="#9-Reduce-White-Point" class="headerlink" title="9.

However, these could be causing random dimming effects, which can be annoying. So, try toggling these features on and off, and you’ll likely fix the issue you’re facing.</p><p> That said, remember that these features aim to protect your eyes and your iPhone. We suggest you keep them enabled, especially if you have vision problems.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ranked-highest-audio-transformation-tools-including-magic/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Ranked Highest Audio Transformation Tools, Including Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-ipads-best-practices-for-clear-voice-recording-for-2024/"><u>[New] IPad's Best Practices for Clear Voice Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-real-time-chromebook-display-logger/"><u>2024 Approved Real-Time Chromebook Display Logger</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721480588032-cant-see-notifications-on-iphone-here-are-7-ways-to-resolve-the-issue/"><u>Can't See Notifications on iPhone?

Touches may register in the wrong locations, and physical buttons may refuse to work.</p><p> The Home Screen or an app could become non-interactive. With a frozen iPhone—different from an iPhone stuck in a boot loop—standard troubleshooting steps will only take you so far.</p><p> But worry not; you’ve come to the right place to seek advice.

To do this, press and hold its app icon until a context menu appears, then tap on<strong>Remove App</strong> and choose<strong>Delete</strong> to confirm.</p><p> Doing so will also delete any app settings from the device that might be causing issues. You can now redownload a fresh copy of the app from the App Store.

If your iPhone isn’t completely unresponsive, you can go to<strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Auto-Lock</strong> and set it to<strong>Never</strong> to speed up the process. Plus, you can go to the Control Center and boost the brightness all the way up and make the battery drain faster.</p><p> With the battery depleted and your iPhone powered down, wait at least 30 seconds before plugging it back into power. The device will start up automatically after a few minutes, as soon as the battery has enough charge for booting. But if draining the battery makes no difference, try putting a frozen iPhone into Recovery Mode.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDUPd69Qfls?si=uIGZG-riskwmVZYg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Fix-a-Frozen-iPhone-With-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#How-to-Fix-a-Frozen-iPhone-With-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix a Frozen iPhone With Recovery Mode"></a>How to Fix a Frozen iPhone With Recovery Mode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ios-downgrade-iphone-recovery-mode-restore-pop-up.jpg"                      alt="an image showing the pop up that appears when mac discovers an iphone in recovery mode"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/HT201263" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Entering Recovery Mode allows you to restore your iPhone from an iCloud or iTunes backup, which may fix the frozen iPhone without deleting any apps or settings.

Check Your AirPods Battery"></a>1. Check Your AirPods Battery</h2><p> It’s possible that one of your AirPods stopped working because it ran out of battery. Each AirPod has its own battery charge, and when it gets drained, that particular AirPod will stop functioning. You’ll have to <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-check-airpod-battery/" >check the battery level of each AirPod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see if that’s the problem.</p><p> Put both AirPods back into the charging case and let them charge for at least 30–60 seconds or up to a few minutes. Then, open the case and hold it near your iPhone to see the battery pop-up. Or, with the case open, use the Settings app to view the AirPods’ battery levels.</p><p> Remember that your AirPods case also has its own battery. For this to work, make sure the AirPods case is also fully charged.</p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz2LYWd8EqI?si=G_3CqFRAmeVPczjj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Restart-the-Connected-Device"><a href="#2-Restart-the-Connected-Device" class="headerlink" title="2.

Adjust the Audio Balance on Your Devices"></a>3. Adjust the Audio Balance on Your Devices</h2><p> Most devices allow you to set the volume level for each AirPod individually. If you or someone else has tweaked this adjustment and routed the audio to only one of the AirPods, that may be why you’re not hearing any sound from the other. It could also be <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-one-airpod-louder-than-other-fixes/" >why one AirPod sounds louder than the other <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when they’re both working.</p><p> To adjust the AirPods audio balance on an iPhone, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility</strong> and scroll down until you see the<strong>Hearing</strong> section. You’ll see a slider with an<strong>L</strong> on the left and an<strong>R</strong> on the right. Adjust this slider so that the marker is in the middle. This ensures both your AirPods play sound at an equal volume.</p><p>Close</p><p> To adjust the AirPods audio balance on Android, open the<strong>Settings</strong> app and search for<strong>Accessibility</strong> . Open that section and find the audio balance slider. Make sure the indicator is in the middle of the slider so both your left and right AirPods are at equal audio levels.</p><p>Close</p><p> On a Mac, you can adjust the AirPods audio balance by opening<strong>System Settings &gt; Sound</strong> and selecting the<strong>Output</strong> tab. Then, make sure your AirPods are selected and set the<strong>Balance</strong> slider to the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-sound-system-settings-airpods-balance.png"                      alt="mac sound system settings airpods balance"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hsPbiic0O8?si=58mZ2Cu6wicQfsUP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> You can adjust the AirPods audio balance on Windows 11 by opening<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Sound</strong> .

Sometimes, one of your AirPods stops working because of a problem with your smartphone or your computer.</p><p> In this case, try using your AirPods with your other devices and see if you can hear the audio on both AirPods.</p><p> If both AirPods work just fine on any other device, you know the issue is with your primary device, and you’ll need to fix it instead. Read <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apple-airpods-problems-fix/" >our AirPods troubleshooting guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your specific device to see if one of the suggested fixes can rectify your problem.</p><h2 id="5-Forget-Your-AirPods-From-Your-Devices"><a href="#5-Forget-Your-AirPods-From-Your-Devices" class="headerlink" title="5. Forget Your AirPods From Your Devices"></a>5. Forget Your AirPods From Your Devices</h2><p> One of the best ways to fix issues with Bluetooth devices is to forget them on your phone or other device and then re-pair them. This allows your device to establish a fresh Bluetooth connection.</p><p> To forget AirPods on an iPhone, open<strong>Settings</strong> app and tap<strong>Bluetooth</strong> . Find your AirPods in the list and tap the<strong>Info (i)</strong> icon next to them. Then, tap<strong>Forget This Device</strong> .</p><p>Close</p><p> To forget AirPods on Android, open<strong>Settings &gt;</strong> <strong>Bluetooth</strong> . Under paired devices, tap the<strong>gear</strong> icon next to your AirPods’ name and then choose<strong>Unpair</strong> or<strong>Forget</strong> , depending on your device.</p><p>Close</p><p> To forget AirPods on a Mac, click the<strong>Control Center</strong> icon in the menu bar and click<strong>Bluetooth &gt; Bluetooth Settings</strong> . The System Settings app will open. Click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> icon next to your AirPods and choose<strong>Forget This Device</strong> .</p><p> To forget AirPods on Windows, click<strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; devices</strong> . Then, click<strong>Devices</strong> and find your AirPods in the list. Click the<strong>three dots</strong> next to their name and choose<strong>Remove device</strong> .</p><p> After unpairing, you need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-connect-airpods-mac-iphone-pc-android/" >re-pair your AirPods to your device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Then, see if both your AirPods work.</p><h2 id="6-Reset-Your-AirPods-to-Factory-Settings"><a href="#6-Reset-Your-AirPods-to-Factory-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6. Reset Your AirPods to Factory Settings"></a>6. Reset Your AirPods to Factory Settings</h2><p> If your AirPods still don’t work after unpairing and re-pairing them, try resetting them to their factory settings. Once they’re unpaired, put your AirPods in their charging case, but don’t close the lid.</p><p> Press and hold the setup button on the back of the AirPods charging case for 15 seconds until the light on the front flashes amber and white. Then, let go of the button and, with the lid open, hold your AirPods case near your iPhone.</p><p> Your iPhone will prompt you to set them up. If you’re using another device, follow the standard Bluetooth setup steps.</p><h2 id="7-Reset-Your-Phone’s-Network-Settings"><a href="#7-Reset-Your-Phone’s-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="7. Reset Your Phone’s Network Settings"></a>7. Reset Your Phone’s Network Settings</h2><p> Your phone’s network settings define how it connects to various other devices. It’s worth changing back to the default settings to see if this fixes the AirPod that’s not working.</p><p> Once the settings are reset, you can manually reconfigure them on your devices. You’ll also need to reconnect to Wi-Fi networks manually after resetting your network settings.</p><p> To <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-iphone/" >reset network settings on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset</strong> and choose<strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> .</p><p>Close</p><p> To <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-android/" >reset the network settings on an Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , open<strong>Settings &gt; System</strong> and tap<strong>Reset options</strong> . Then, tap<strong>Reset Wi-Fi, mobile &amp; Bluetooth</strong> and confirm your selection by tapping<strong>Reset settings</strong> . Note that the exact steps may vary slightly depending on your Android device.</p><p>Close</p><p> If you can only hear audio from one of your AirPods, use the methods outlined above and see if you can get your faulty AirPod to function properly again. If the issue is due to misconfigured settings or a software bug, you should be able to fix it in most cases.</p><p> If your left or right AirPod still doesn’t work even after following the above steps, your AirPod’s hardware might be at fault.

Regardless of where you lost your device, Apple’s Find My app simplifies the tedious process of locating it. We’ll teach you how to use Find My to track and find your lost iPhone.</p><h2 id="Accessing-Apple’s-Find-My-Network"><a href="#Accessing-Apple’s-Find-My-Network" class="headerlink" title="Accessing Apple’s Find My Network"></a>Accessing Apple’s Find My Network</h2><p> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-my/id1514844621" >Find My app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to locate any of your Apple devices and even choose to get directions to that location and lock the device until you arrive. Since you lost your iPhone, you have two options to access the Find My network.</p><p> Find My is enabled on iPhones by default. However, if you disabled this setting before you lost your iPhone, it won’t appear on Apple’s Find My network.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Your-Other-Apple-Devices"><a href="#1-Use-Your-Other-Apple-Devices" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Your Other Apple Devices"></a>1. Use Your Other Apple Devices</h3><p> If you own more than one Apple device, like an iPad or Mac, you can use the Find My app on it to locate your missing iPhone.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-spotlight-iphone-save-time/" >Use the Spotlight search feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find and open it quickly.

Use the iCloud Website From Any Device</h3><p> If you don’t have any other Apple devices, you can use a non-Apple device, like your Windows PC, to access the iCloud website instead. It doesn’t matter if you use someone else’s device for this as long as you remember to sign out afterward.</p><p> Open any web browser on any device, head to <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/find/" >icloud.com&#x2F;find <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and sign in with your Apple ID. You should be able to view all your devices under the<strong>All Devices</strong> section. The web version of the Find My app offers all the same features you need to locate your lost or stolen Apple devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/finding-a-lost-device-using-icloud.png"                      alt="finding a lost device using iCloud"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Locate-Your-Lost-iPhone-on-Find-My"><a href="#How-to-Locate-Your-Lost-iPhone-on-Find-My" class="headerlink" title="How to Locate Your Lost iPhone on Find My"></a>How to Locate Your Lost iPhone on Find My</h2><p> Find My uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals to show the approximate location of your iPhone. The location is usually accurate to within a few hundred feet.</p><p> However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-my-iphone-offline-meaning/" >if Find My shows your iPhone as offline <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you may only see its last known location—if there is one. Offline devices can show up with a black screen in the Find My app. This might happen if your device ran out of battery or if someone turned it off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/offline-devices-appearing-in-find-my-website.png"                      alt="Offline Devices appearing in Find My website"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5gTm5KxtQ0?si=onF1rBS2nEM5nLGg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As mentioned earlier, there’s no point in using Find My if you disabled the feature on your lost iPhone.

This would happen when someone powers on the device or if it connects to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth again.</p><p> To set this up in Find My, select the missing iPhone and toggle on<strong>Notify When Found</strong> . On a Mac, you need to select your offline device and click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to it on the map to access the<strong>Notify When Found</strong> toggle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/toggling-notify-when-found.png"                      alt="toggling Notify When Found"                ></p><p> The Find My app will send you a notification, and Apple will email you the location of your lost or stolen iPhone as soon as it goes online.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDUPd69Qfls?si=uIGZG-riskwmVZYg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Get-Directions-to-Your-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Get-Directions-to-Your-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Get Directions to Your Lost or Stolen iPhone"></a>Get Directions to Your Lost or Stolen iPhone</h3><p> If your lost iPhone or iPad is online, you can use the Find My app to get directions to its location. Select your device in Find My and hit<strong>Directions</strong> . On a Mac, you need to select your iPhone in Find My, then click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to it on the map to access this option.</p><p> Apple Maps will launch and load a route from your current location to your lost device. Unfortunately, you won’t find this option in Find My’s web client. You’ll only see it in the Find My app on one of your Apple devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/getting-direction-to-lost-device.png"                      alt="Directions option for a device in Find My app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKjioJQaUh8?si=Ls_AeuvGsSyL5ny2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> You shouldn’t try to retrieve your iPhone if you believe it was stolen. Instead, follow the instructions below to enable Lost Mode and contact law enforcement agencies to tell them where it is.</p><h3 id="Play-a-Sound-to-Find-Your-Missing-iPhone"><a href="#Play-a-Sound-to-Find-Your-Missing-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Play a Sound to Find Your Missing iPhone"></a>Play a Sound to Find Your Missing iPhone</h3><p> The Find My app only offers a vague location for your lost iPhone. This might help you narrow it down to work, home, or the supermarket. But you’ll still struggle to find it if it’s tucked beneath a couch cushion or at the bottom of the laundry basket.</p><p> Fortunately, you can use Find My to make your iPhone play a loud sound, making it easier to find when you’re nearby.</p><p> You’ll find the<strong>Play Sound</strong> button once you select your missing iPhone in Find My, whether you’re using the web client or the native app on iPhone or iPad. On a Mac, remember to click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button after selecting it to access this option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/playing-sound-in-find-my-app.png"                      alt="playing sound in find my app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBMTAJBx-X4?si=sje5pFJXiHzJJGbP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Your iPhone will keep playing a sound until you find and unlock it or someone else powers off the device. Not that your iPhone must be connected to the internet for this to work.</p><h3 id="Enable-Lost-Mode-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Enable-Lost-Mode-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Enable Lost Mode if You Still Can’t Find Your iPhone"></a>Enable Lost Mode if You Still Can’t Find Your iPhone</h3><p> It’s always a good idea to enable Lost Mode if you can’t get your hands on your missing iPhone right away.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-apple-lost-mode/" >The Lost Mode option on Find My <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suspends Apple Pay and locks your device. And if your missing iPhone doesn’t have a passcode set, you’ll be prompted to create one.</p><p> You can also use Lost Mode to display a message on the screen telling whoever finds it that this device belongs to you, along with details on how to reach you. Your device will still receive phone calls in Lost Mode, but it won’t display any alerts.</p><p> To enable Lost Mode, select your device in Find My and hit<strong>Activate</strong> under the<strong>Mark As Lost</strong> option. Then, follow the prompts to create a passcode (if you don’t already have one) and write a message for people to see when they find your iPhone. Then, choose<strong>Activate</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/marking-device-as-lost.png"                      alt="marking device as lost in Find My"                ></p><p> Lost Mode keeps your data intact. You won’t lose anything if you recover your iPhone and disable Lost Mode with your passcode.</p><h3 id="Only-Erase-Your-Device-if-You-Never-Expect-to-Find-It"><a href="#Only-Erase-Your-Device-if-You-Never-Expect-to-Find-It" class="headerlink" title="Only Erase Your Device if You Never Expect to Find It"></a>Only Erase Your Device if You Never Expect to Find It</h3><p> Find My also lets you remotely erase all the data on your lost iPhone or iPad. However, you should only use this option if you never expect to find your missing device again.</p><p> Once you use Find My to erase a missing iPhone, you can’t track its location anymore. No one else can use your device because it’s locked to your Apple ID with Activation Lock. But you’re unlikely to find it again because you can’t use Find My to see where it is.</p><p> We only recommend this option if you’ve given up on ever getting your device back. You’ll find the<strong>Erase This Device</strong> option at the bottom once you select your iPhone in Find My.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/erasing-lost-iphone.png"                      alt="erasing lost iPhone in Find My"                ></p><p> Keep in mind that your iPhone must be connected to the internet to start this process.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Get-Your-Silent-iPhone-Ringing-Again-A-List-of-11-Effective-Remedies"><a href="#How-to-Get-Your-Silent-iPhone-Ringing-Again-A-List-of-11-Effective-Remedies" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Your Silent iPhone Ringing Again: A List of 11 Effective Remedies"></a>How to Get Your Silent iPhone Ringing Again: A List of 11 Effective Remedies</h2><p> If you’re receiving notifications of missed calls yet didn’t hear your iPhone ringing for incoming calls earlier, it’s likely due to misconfigured settings, software bugs, or hardware problems. When these issues persist, continuing to unknowingly miss important family and work calls is never good.</p><p> But don’t worry. We’ll walk you through the solutions so that you won’t miss a call this way again. Let’s look at what you can do when your iPhone can receive calls but doesn’t seem to ring at the time the call comes in.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Test-Your-iPhone’s-Speakers"><a href="#1-Test-Your-iPhone’s-Speakers" class="headerlink" title="1. Test Your iPhone’s Speakers"></a>1. Test Your iPhone’s Speakers</h2><p> The first step is to test your iPhone’s speakers to rule out hardware issues. Open YouTube or any other music app and play something. Use the<strong>Volume Up</strong> button on the side of your device to increase the volume level.</p><p> Once you’re confident that the speaker is working, the likely reasons your iPhone doesn’t ring are bad settings or temporary software glitches.</p><h2 id="2-Turn-Off-Silent-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-Off-Silent-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn Off Silent Mode"></a>2. Turn Off Silent Mode</h2><p><img src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/14af88c4727edfc68754682f8d9e5a16b4632ead51b56f451896cf5d83dd52e4.jpg" alt="iPhone Ring/Silent switch"></p><p> If your iPhone is set to Silent mode, it won’t ring when you get a call. To fix this, put your phone back in Ring mode by pressing the Ring&#x2F;Silent switch towards the screen. You’ll find this switch on the top-left side of your iPhone, above the volume buttons.</p><p> When in Ring mode, the slider will be closer to your iPhone’s screen. In Silent mode, it displays an orange strip.</p><h2 id="3-Disconnect-Bluetooth-Audio-Devices"><a href="#3-Disconnect-Bluetooth-Audio-Devices" class="headerlink" title="3. Disconnect Bluetooth Audio Devices"></a>3. Disconnect Bluetooth Audio Devices</h2><p> If you leave wireless audio devices like AirPods connected to your iPhone, your incoming call ringtone may play through these instead of the phone’s speakers. This mostly happens with third-party earbuds that don’t automatically sense when you’re wearing them.</p><p> You can disconnect all wireless devices by opening the<strong>Control Center</strong> and tapping the<strong>Bluetooth</strong> icon. The icon turns from blue to gray when Bluetooth is disabled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7377.JPEG"                      alt="bluetooth enabled in iphone control center"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7378.JPEG"                      alt="bluetooth disabled in iphone control center"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sk53d1bBhY?si=yaTeDogLb3D4dYu1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> To disconnect devices individually instead, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Bluetooth</strong> . Tap the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to the device and tap<strong>Disconnect</strong> . Once your Bluetooth devices are disconnected, incoming calls should play via your iPhone’s speakers.</p><h2 id="4-Turn-the-Ringtone-Volume-Up"><a href="#4-Turn-the-Ringtone-Volume-Up" class="headerlink" title="4. Turn the Ringtone Volume Up"></a>4. Turn the Ringtone Volume Up</h2><p> If your ringtone volume is too low, you may not hear a call coming in if your iPhone is in your bag. So, it may appear that your iPhone didn’t ring at all. You can quickly fix this by increasing the ring volume. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> and tap<strong>Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong> .</li><li>Drag the<strong>Ringtone and Alert Volume</strong> slider to the right. The further right it is, the louder your ringtone will be.</li></ol><p> On the same page, you might also want to toggle off<strong>Change with Buttons</strong> . Doing so will prevent you from accidentally lowering the ringtone volume when you’re changing the volume in gaming or video apps. When this option is disabled, the volume buttons only change the volume for media, not your ringtone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-sound--haptics-in-iphone-settings.JPEG"                      alt="Tap Sound &amp; Haptics in iPhone Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_5647.jpg"                      alt="ringtone volume iphone"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-Choose-a-Different-or-Louder-Ringtone"><a href="#5-Choose-a-Different-or-Louder-Ringtone" class="headerlink" title="5. Choose a Different or Louder Ringtone"></a>5. Choose a Different or Louder Ringtone</h2><p> Sometimes, you might miss phone calls because your ringtone isn’t loud or piercing enough. In this case, you should try out other ringtones and use the one that’s the easiest to hear.</p><p>Follow these steps to change your iPhone’s ringtone:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> and tap<strong>Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong> .</li><li>Tap<strong>Ringtone</strong> .</li><li>From here, tap to hear the different tones.

Restart Your iPhone"></a>7. Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> Restarting your device is a simple and effective way to fix common issues without much trouble. If your phone doesn’t ring even after trying the above solutions, restart your iPhone by manually turning it off and back on.</p><p> Fortunately, it’s easy to <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restart your iPhone, even if its buttons are broken <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="8-Enable-Cellular-Data-or-Connect-to-a-Wi-Fi-Network"><a href="#8-Enable-Cellular-Data-or-Connect-to-a-Wi-Fi-Network" class="headerlink" title="8.

Enable Cellular Data or Connect to a Wi-Fi Network</h2><p> This particular solution applies if you’re receiving notifications of missed calls on apps like WhatsApp and Messenger, yet found that your iPhone did not ring at all when the caller was contacting you.</p><p> Such messenger apps require an active internet connection to work. Therefore, if your iPhone isn’t connected, the apps will only inform you that you have missed calls when your device has an internet connection later.</p><p> If you frequently use third-party apps for texts and calls, it’s best to enable mobile data or connect your iPhone to a Wi-Fi network throughout the day. In the<strong>Control Center</strong> , tap the<strong>Cellular Data</strong> toggle. It turns green when enabled. For a Wi-Fi connection, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Wi-Fi</strong> and select an available network to connect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7380.JPEG"                      alt="enable mobile data in iphone control center"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7382.JPEG"                      alt="iphone settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7379.JPEG"                      alt="iphone wifi settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/620kcQ7Dw7w?si=a5ussGs5HV7sG3hF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="9-Fix-an-iPhone-Stuck-in-Headphone-Mode"><a href="#9-Fix-an-iPhone-Stuck-in-Headphone-Mode" class="headerlink" title="9.

But in case you’re still having problems, make sure you update your iPhone.</p><p> Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> to see if a new iOS version is available for your device. Additionally,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-manually-or-automatically-update-apps-iphone/" >update your iPhone apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like WhatsApp, Skype, and Zoom to ensure app-specific bugs aren’t causing the issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/img_6668.JPEG"                      alt="iphone settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/img_6731.JPEG"                      alt="iphone general settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Finally, if nothing else works, open <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset &gt; Reset All Settings</strong> . This won’t erase personal data like music, photos, and apps.

You can send books, movies, music, videos, and apps from your Apple apps to a friend if they use Apple’s media services like Apple Music or the App Store.</p><p> However, sometimes you might be unable to send gifts from your device. So, if you’re experiencing such an issue, here are some possible reasons.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/793ViIxl4tI?si=DDBkjPlPX5bZ-f1Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-The-Recipient-Lives-in-a-Different-Country-or-Region"><a href="#1-The-Recipient-Lives-in-a-Different-Country-or-Region" class="headerlink" title="1. The Recipient Lives in a Different Country or Region"></a>1. The Recipient Lives in a Different Country or Region</h2><p> Similar to how the recipient of an <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-gift-card-vs-app-store-gift-card-vs-apple-store-gift-card/" >Apple Gift Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can’t use it outside the country where it was purchased, the recipient of a gift from an Apple device can’t use it outside of the country or region where it was sent because their Apple ID is in a different country or region.</p><p> For instance, if you’re going to gift an app or game from the App Store in the United States, the person you’re sending it to must also have an Apple ID in the United States. However, they can work around this by <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dont-switch-international-itunes-media-app-store-youve-read/" >changing their App Store country <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but it has its own set of drawbacks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7JBG_O3Vnh4?si=lUO0fta6YPJ50qjg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-You’re-in-an-Unsupported-Country-or-Region"><a href="#2-You’re-in-an-Unsupported-Country-or-Region" class="headerlink" title="2. You’re in an Unsupported Country or Region"></a>2. You’re in an Unsupported Country or Region</h2><p> You might be unable to send gifts because you can’t buy music, apps, movies, or books in your country or region. This is because certain countries or regions cannot access some Apple services. For instance, if you live in Croatia, you won’t be able to gift books from the App Store.</p><p> It’s possible to solve this problem by changing your App Store and iTunes country, but, as we mentioned earlier, it has a few issues of its own. You can visit <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411" >Apple Support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn what Apple services your country can access.</p><h2 id="3-Your-Family-Sharing-Settings"><a href="#3-Your-Family-Sharing-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can send gifts from the App Store, Apple Books, or iTunes Store on an iPhone or iPad. On a Mac or PC, you can send gifts using the iTunes Store.</p><p> You need an iPhone or iPad to gift apps, TV shows, or movies and a Mac or PC to gift individual songs. For now, there’s no workaround for this.</p><h2 id="5-You’re-Trying-to-Gift-a-Free-App"><a href="#5-You’re-Trying-to-Gift-a-Free-App" class="headerlink" title="5.

While you can only gift paid items, it is possible to share free ones as well. To do so, tap the share button beside the app, then select a recipient or your means of sending it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDuvbv0QOYI?si=byottcEM_Rrvi4EL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Make-the-Most-of-Apple’s-Gifting-Feature"><a href="#Make-the-Most-of-Apple’s-Gifting-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Make the Most of Apple’s Gifting Feature"></a>Make the Most of Apple’s Gifting Feature</h2><p> Looking for a great gift for a loved one who’s also an Apple user?

If so, you’re probably staring at “an unknown error occurred (14)” popup on your computer. To make matters worse, the chances are you also can’t boot into iOS.</p><p> But don’t worry. Working your way through the solution below just might save you a trip down to the Apple Store. Let’s get started.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nGlyEL5K6Y?si=3KZhTTBvKcPmyS68" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Causes-Error-14"><a href="#What-Causes-Error-14" class="headerlink" title="What Causes Error 14?"></a>What Causes Error 14?</h2><p> The “an unknown error occurred (14)” popup (or simply error 14) occurs while updating or restoring an iPhone that’s close to running out of storage. But that’s not the only reason. A faulty USB cable, an outdated version of iTunes or Finder, or a corrupt IPSW (iPhone Software) file can all contribute.</p><p> Error 14 usually ends up forcing your iPhone into a boot loop. To fix the issue, you must enter Recovery Mode. You then have the option to perform another update or restore and get the device functioning correctly again.</p><h2 id="Using-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Using-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Using Recovery Mode"></a>Using Recovery Mode</h2><p> As its name implies, Recovery Mode is a recovery environment that you can use to update or restore a malfunctioning iPhone. However, it requires a somewhat confusing set of button presses to get to. You can find all about entering and using Recovery Mode in our separate post. We recommend referring to it as you work your way through each fix.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restart-iphone-recovery-mode/" >How to Force Restart an iPhone and Enter Recovery Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In some instances, encountering error 14 forces your iPhone to boot into Recovery Mode. If you see a screen displaying an image of a computer and a USB cable, you don’t have to enter Recovery Mode manually. Simply connecting it to your Mac or PC should suffice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-recovery-mode.png"                      alt="iPhone in Recovery Mode on the Mac."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rBnnLFJbvr4?si=LlHYrYlOBp7NLMec" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Recovery Mode presents you with two different options. The first option (<strong>Update</strong>) lets you update your iPhone without losing your data. The second option (<strong>Reset iPhone</strong>)<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-factory-reset-iphone-ipad/" >resets your device to factory settings. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> If you have a backup, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restore-iphone-ipad-from-backup/" >restore your iPhone backup at a later time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Change-USB-Port-or-Cable"><a href="#Change-USB-Port-or-Cable" class="headerlink" title="Change USB Port or Cable"></a>Change USB Port or Cable</h2><p> The most likely reason for the error 14 on the iPhone is a frayed out or faulty Lightning cable. Try changing USB ports or use a different cord (ideally from another iOS device).</p><p> You can also use a third-party USB Lightning cord. Just make sure that it’s MFi (Made for iPhone) certified.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-lightning-cable.jpg"                      alt="Lightning cable for the iPhone."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kiW7sLvL65k?si=IHSeRFsYCrfqpn2o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Disable-Third-Party-Security-Software"><a href="#Disable-Third-Party-Security-Software" class="headerlink" title="Disable Third-Party Security Software"></a>Disable Third-Party Security Software</h2><p> Third-party security software can interfere with iTunes or Finder and prevent the software from communicating with your iOS device. Try deactivating any security software applications on your PC or Mac and check if that helps.</p><h2 id="Update-iTunes-or-Finder"><a href="#Update-iTunes-or-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Update iTunes or Finder"></a>Update iTunes or Finder</h2><p> If the issue persists, you must <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-itunes-mac/" >update iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You can do that via the App Store (Mac) or the Microsoft Store (PC).</p><p> However, if you use a Mac running macOS Catalina or later, you need to use Finder to interact with your iPhone. The only way to update Finder is by updating the Mac’s system software. To do that, open the<strong>Apple</strong> menu and go to<strong>About This Mac</strong> &gt;<strong>Software Update</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-update-system-software.png"                      alt="Updating the system software on a Mac."                ></p><h2 id="Delete-the-IPSW-File-and-Retry"><a href="#Delete-the-IPSW-File-and-Retry" class="headerlink" title="Delete the IPSW File and Retry"></a>Delete the IPSW File and Retry</h2><p> iTunes and Finder download an IPSW file while updating or restoring your iPhone. It’s what contains the data needed to update or reinstall iOS.</p><p> However, a corrupt IPSW file can also result in error 14. Deleting it should force iTunes or Finder to re-download a fresh copy of the file the next time you update or restore the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4-ipsw-folder.png"                      alt="Finder displaying the iPhone Software Updates folder."                ></p><h3 id="How-to-Delete-an-IPSW-File-in-macOS"><a href="#How-to-Delete-an-IPSW-File-in-macOS" class="headerlink" title="How to Delete an IPSW File in macOS"></a>How to Delete an IPSW File in macOS</h3><p> Open<strong>Finder</strong> .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Illuminate-the-Darkness-Again-Top-12-Methods-to-Repair-Your-iPhone-Flashlight"><a href="#Illuminate-the-Darkness-Again-Top-12-Methods-to-Repair-Your-iPhone-Flashlight" class="headerlink" title="Illuminate the Darkness Again: Top 12 Methods to Repair Your iPhone Flashlight"></a>Illuminate the Darkness Again: Top 12 Methods to Repair Your iPhone Flashlight</h2><p> Long gone are the days when you need to search for a flashlight in some forgotten drawer or storage box, worry whether you still have the correct batteries to turn it on, or groan in frustration when it’s not bright enough anyway. Nowadays, you can just turn to the multi-functional iPhone you have in your hand. That is, provided your iPhone’s flashlight is working.</p><p> It’s a massive hindrance when your iPhone’s flashlight stops working and you see a grayed-out flashlight icon. So, let’s look at the various solutions you can try to get your iPhone torch working again.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Turn-Off-Low-Power-Mode"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Low-Power-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Off Low Power Mode"></a>1. Turn Off Low Power Mode</h2><p> Low Power Mode disables some features on your iPhone to conserve battery power. When it’s activated, the color of your battery level appears yellow instead of green.</p><p> The Low Power Mode prompt automatically comes up when your battery percentage falls below 20 percent.

To turn off Low Power Mode, go to the<strong>Settings</strong> app, select<strong>Battery</strong> , and tap to toggle off<strong>Low Power Mode</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-1.JPG"                      alt="iphone settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-2.JPG"                      alt="turn off low power mode in iphone settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="2-Charge-Your-iPhone"><a href="#2-Charge-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="2. Charge Your iPhone"></a>2. Charge Your iPhone</h2><p> Even after you turn off Low Power Mode, you may find that your iPhone’s flashlight still doesn’t work. This may be simply because your device doesn’t have enough battery power left to support the feature at that moment. Therefore, you should plug your iPhone into a power source and start charging it.</p><p> The flashlight feature should start working again once your iPhone has sufficient power.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg3PHS_Ee80?si=fE_iGIqHjKvWFIN3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Check-Your-iPhone-Isn’t-Too-Hot"><a href="#3-Check-Your-iPhone-Isn’t-Too-Hot" class="headerlink" title="3. Check Your iPhone Isn’t Too Hot"></a>3. Check Your iPhone Isn’t Too Hot</h2><p> When your iPhone gets too hot, the flashlight may stop working. It’s not advisable to continue using an overheating iPhone. If your device exceeds a particular temperature limit, it will eventually shut down until it cools off. You’ll also see a warning appear on your screen if the temperature gets too high.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blue-iphone-pro.jpg"                      alt="blue iphone pro on white surface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7fATC_lI7o?si=UFotPJqflDRZr-mv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> To allow your device’s temperature to drop naturally, place your iPhone in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Do not attempt to put your device into the fridge, though, as this will cause damage to it. Just find somewhere that’s naturally cool and shady. Once your device cools down, your iPhone’s flashlight should start working again.</p><h2 id="4-Remove-the-Flashlight-From-the-Control-Center"><a href="#4-Remove-the-Flashlight-From-the-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="4. Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center"></a>4. Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</h2><p> If your iPhone’s torch still isn’t working, another potential fix is to remove the flashlight option from the Control Center and then add it back again. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Go to the<strong>Settings</strong> app. Select<strong>Control Center</strong> .</li><li>Under<strong>Included Controls</strong> , tap the red<strong>minus (–)</strong> icon for<strong>Flashlight</strong> (or<strong>Torch</strong> , in some regions). Tap<strong>Remove</strong> to confirm.</li><li>To add the flashlight back, scroll down to the<strong>More Controls</strong> section.</li><li>Tap the<strong>plus (+)</strong> icon for<strong>Flashlight</strong> (or<strong>Torch</strong>).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-1.JPG"                      alt="iphone settings app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hS27nZVi9Y?si=_Zqj_l4a4XkPqT2S" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-3.JPG"                      alt="customize iphone control center"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-settings-4.JPG"                      alt="customize iphone control center"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XoC2TGp1PLY?si=iH9xs76NhWn4pP-E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-Close-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App"><a href="#5-Close-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="5. Close Your iPhone’s Camera App"></a>5. Close Your iPhone’s Camera App</h2><p> Your iPhone’s camera’s flash function uses the same light as the flashlight. If you have the<strong>Camera</strong> app opened, it’s normal to see the Control Center’s flashlight icon grayed out. This is because you can’t use both features at the same time.</p><p> To solve this, just exit the<strong>Camera</strong> app and access your<strong>Control Center</strong> again. You should see that the flashlight button can once more be selected as usual.</p><h2 id="6-Turn-On-Your-Flashlight-Using-the-Camera-Flash"><a href="#6-Turn-On-Your-Flashlight-Using-the-Camera-Flash" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn On Your Flashlight Using the Camera Flash"></a>6. Turn On Your Flashlight Using the Camera Flash</h2><p> If you can’t turn on your iPhone’s flashlight from the Control Center, a workaround is to turn it on in the<strong>Camera</strong> app by activating the flash function. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>In the<strong>Camera</strong> app, go to<strong>Video</strong> mode.</li><li>Swipe up from the bottom menu (on the word,<strong>Video</strong>) to bring up more options.</li><li>Tap the<strong>Flash</strong> icon. Select<strong>On</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/video-mode-1.JPG"                      alt="iphone camera video mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/video-mode-2.JPG"                      alt="iphone camera video mode options"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/video-mode-3.JPG"                      alt="turn on iphone camera flash"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqBKCGAKHmA?si=OkoaI17nE5qNqTHj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BmegThMdrJE?si=rILo1FJb9DgnPljV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Toggle-the-Flash-in-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App"><a href="#7-Toggle-the-Flash-in-Your-iPhone’s-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="7.

Toggle the Flash in Your iPhone’s Camera App</h2><p> To get rid of glitches that stop your iPhone’s flashlight from working, you can also try turning your camera flash on and off. The steps are the same as the workaround to turn on your iPhone’s camera flash, as discussed in the previous solution. But instead of leaving the<strong>Flash</strong> set to<strong>On</strong> , toggle between<strong>On</strong> and<strong>Off</strong> a few times.</p><h2 id="8-Ask-Siri-to-Turn-On-Your-iPhone’s-Flashlight"><a href="#8-Ask-Siri-to-Turn-On-Your-iPhone’s-Flashlight" class="headerlink" title="8.

Ask Siri to Turn On Your iPhone’s Flashlight</h2><p> If your camera flash doesn’t seem to be working either, there’s another way to enable your iPhone’s flashlight: Siri. Unless your device is absolutely low on battery, Siri can help you turn on your iPhone’s flashlight even if the icon is grayed out.</p><p> First,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-and-use-siri-iphone/" >set up Siri on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Next, long-press the Side button on your iPhone or say, “Hey Siri.” When the<strong>Siri</strong> icon pops up on your iPhone screen, say, “Turn on the flashlight.” Your flashlight should turn on instantly, and Siri will also say that it’s on now.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_7829.JPEG"                      alt="siri icon on iphone screen"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_7830.JPEG"                      alt="siri response after turning on iphone flashlight"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSFNIAYChbA?si=4TIlsUrYmY5vP2il" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="9-Update-Your-iPhone’s-iOS"><a href="#9-Update-Your-iPhone’s-iOS" class="headerlink" title="9.

So, perhaps all you need to do to fix your iPhone’s flashlight is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >update your iPhone to the latest version of iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> to see if an update is available for your iPhone.

Tap<strong>Reset</strong> and choose<strong>Reset All Settings</strong> from the pop-up menu. You won’t lose any data from your iPhone; all this does is revert your iPhone’s settings to factory default values.</p><p> Take note that the reset process can take a long time, especially if you have a lot of data on your iPhone. So, if you’re stuck in the dark and urgently need a flashlight, don’t rely on resetting your iPhone right there and then!</p><p> Make sure you don’t accidentally choose<strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> from the<strong>Reset</strong> menu. Doing that would delete all the data on your device.</p><h2 id="Effective-Solutions-When-Your-iPhone’s-Flashlight-Is-Not-Working"><a href="#Effective-Solutions-When-Your-iPhone’s-Flashlight-Is-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Effective Solutions When Your iPhone’s Flashlight Is Not Working"></a>Effective Solutions When Your iPhone’s Flashlight Is Not Working</h2><p> If you’ve been stuck wondering why the flashlight won’t work on your iPhone, we hope this list of fixes has helped you resolve the problem effectively.</p><p> However, if the issue persists, it’s best for you to contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider.

Here’s How to Restore Sync with Android Phones"></a>Missing Texts on iPhone? Here’s How to Restore Sync with Android Phones</h2><p> Most iPhone users communicate with iMessage, which works with cellular data or Wi-Fi. Apple’s iMessage service allows fast communication with other Apple users while offering features like Memoji stickers and read receipts.</p><p> But what if you have an iPhone that does not receive texts from Android? If this is happening to you, you’re not alone. Many people report having issues with this as well.</p><p> Luckily, there are a few fixes to try that will get you receiving messages from Android phones again in no time.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBWcw6rXIdg?si=Tlue44bW-bPA4tH9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Make-Sure-MMS-and-Group-Messaging-Are-Enabled"><a href="#1-Make-Sure-MMS-and-Group-Messaging-Are-Enabled" class="headerlink" title="1.

Make Sure MMS and Group Messaging Are Enabled</h2><p> While all iPhones can receive text messages by default, some might have MMS and Group Messaging disabled. If an Android user sends a picture, emoji, sticker, or group message, you won’t receive it on your iPhone until the MMS and Group Messaging options are enabled.</p><p> You may not realize that you have these off if you receive pictures or emojis over iMessage from other iPhone users. That’s because iMessage doesn’t need MMS enabled to receive pictures.</p><p> To enable MMS Messaging and Group Messaging, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Messages</strong> &gt;<strong>MMS</strong> <strong>Messaging</strong> and turn this on. Then, turn on<strong>Group Messaging</strong> , which is right below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mms-messages.jpg"                      alt="mms messages"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMuxjTCMX2E?si=ylRTMJuUstpjLsZc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> This is the most common fix for this issue, but if this doesn’t work, there are still several more fixes you can try.</p><h2 id="2-Make-Sure-the-Number-Isn’t-Blocked"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-the-Number-Isn’t-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-Ways-to-Tackle-the-7-Biggest-Headaches-with-Your-iPhone-X"><a href="#Best-Ways-to-Tackle-the-7-Biggest-Headaches-with-Your-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="Best Ways to Tackle the 7 Biggest Headaches with Your iPhone X"></a>Best Ways to Tackle the 7 Biggest Headaches with Your iPhone X</h2><p> The iPhone X (<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-x-review/" >our review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) introduced a few big new features to Apple’s smartphone lineup when it released in late 2017. Unfortunately, it also debuted a few new issues specific to the redesign.</p><p> Fortunately there are workarounds and fixes for most of them. Some will depend on which version of iOS you’re running, while others require workarounds or intervention from Apple.</p><p> So let’s take a look at some of the frustrations, design flaws, and defects that iPhone X users can encounter, and attempt to solve them.</p><h2 id="1-Face-ID-Won’t-Work"><a href="#1-Face-ID-Won’t-Work" class="headerlink" title="1. Face ID Won’t Work"></a>1. Face ID Won’t Work</h2><p> Probably the most common complaint about the iPhone X relates to the TrueDepth camera and Face ID. Just like Touch ID on older devices, Face ID doesn’t work properly all the time.</p><p> To prevent issues, make sure to wipe the “notch” on your iPhone X regularly (an important part of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/" >iPhone cleaning <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). There’s an array of sensors, cameras, and projectors in that small space, and they must be able to see you clearly in order to work.</p><p> Secondly, scan your face in a well-lit area. Scanning in low light isn’t as accurate as scanning in daylight. If you’ve changed your appearance significantly, or you’re having persistent Face ID recognition issues, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong> and choose<strong>Reset Face ID</strong> . You can then set it up again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iphone_x_19.jpg"                      alt="iPhone X TrueDepth &quot;notch&quot;"                ></p><p> When Face ID fails and prompts you for a passcode, it attempts to learn and adapt to your appearance to prevent the same problem happening again. But if someone else unlocks your phone with your passcode, it may lead to unwanted changes to your Face ID profile. We don’t know for certain how Face ID works, but resetting your profile from time to time may help.</p><p> Some users have reported that Face ID refuses to work altogether. This is an issue that Apple has <a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/face-id-rear-camera-repair-iphone-x/" >acknowledged <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , prompting replacements of the camera unit (both front and rear-facing) on affected devices. Some users have had their devices replaced entirely.</p><p> If you have persistent problems with Face ID, head to <a class="link"   href="http://www.apple.com/support" >Apple Support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to arrange an appointment at a retail store or a mail-in return. And if you’re wondering if Face ID is safe to use in the first place, it’s important to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/safe-use-face-id-new-iphone/" >understand how exactly Face ID works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Accidentally-Taking-a-Lot-of-Screenshots"><a href="#2-Accidentally-Taking-a-Lot-of-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="2. Accidentally Taking a Lot of Screenshots"></a>2. Accidentally Taking a Lot of Screenshots</h2><p> The iPhone X doesn’t have a home button, which means you can’t take screenshots using the conventional<strong>Home + Power</strong> button combination. Instead, you need to press<strong>Volume Up + Side Button</strong> , a shortcut that’s easy to trigger in your pocket or when holding the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/quadlock_iphonex-670x468.jpg"                      alt="QuadLock iPhone X Bike Mount"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaWcXdTn5SE?si=QbxEkX-4a17J5RVs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> There’s no way to change the shortcut, which means the only fix is a workaround. You’ll need to get a case with a recessed side button, which prevents you from unwittingly triggering the shortcut. The Quad Lock case (above) that I use on my iPhone X is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-iphone-x-cases/" >many quality iPhone X cases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to incorporate this into the design.</p><h2 id="3-iPhone-X-Hair-Pulling"><a href="#3-iPhone-X-Hair-Pulling" class="headerlink" title="3. iPhone X Hair Pulling"></a>3. iPhone X Hair Pulling</h2><p> According to some user reports, the gap between the iPhone X chassis and screen bezel is a magnet for hair. Whether you have long flowing locks or a bushy beard, Apple is even offering to replace your iPhone X if this is posing too much of a problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iphone_x_7.jpg"                      alt="iPhone X"                ></p><p> It’s not clear whether that means some models of the iPhone X are worse for this. A snug case that covers the bezel gap should fix the issue (while protecting your device at the same time).</p><h2 id="4-Screen-Issues-Color-Shift-Screen-Burn-and-Green-Lines"><a href="#4-Screen-Issues-Color-Shift-Screen-Burn-and-Green-Lines" class="headerlink" title="4. Screen Issues: Color Shift, Screen Burn, and Green Lines"></a>4. Screen Issues: Color Shift, Screen Burn, and Green Lines</h2><p> The iPhone X uses the first OLED display ever seen in an iPhone. Though Apple has used OLED displays before in both the Apple Watch and MacBook Pro Touch Bar, the iPhone X represents a leap forward in iPhone screen technology. Unfortunately, it’s not without its share of issues.</p><p> Some users (myself included) have noticed a slight shift in color hue when moving the display. I notice this most on an off-white background, with a slight blueish hue visibly “moving” across the screen as the device is tilted. On its website,<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208191" >Apple says <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</p><blockquote><p>“If you look at an OLED display off-angle, you might notice slight shifts in color and hue. This is a characteristic of OLED and is normal behavior.”</p></blockquote><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/save-screen-prevent-burn-in-amoled-screens/" >Screen burn is another OLED “expected behavior” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> listed on Apple’s website. As the name suggests, this refers to a persistent image getting stuck on-screen, even after that image is no longer being displayed. Apple recommends a few tips to avoid screen burn:</p><ul><li>Ensuring<strong>Auto-Brightness</strong> is enabled under <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display Accommodations</strong> .</li><li>Choosing an<strong>Auto Lock</strong> time of 30 or 60 seconds under<strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Auto Lock</strong> .</li><li>Avoid displaying static images for extended periods, particularly at maximum brightness. Use Control Center to manually adjust your device brightness if necessary.</li></ul><p> The final display issue relates to vertical green lines appearing on the screen over time. This is not normal, and Apple has replaced affected units as the issue appears. It seems this was related to early iPhone X models. The fix here is to contact Apple for a replacement.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=lhdUUVYMVQjzHXBh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Phone-Call-and-Touch-Screen-Delay-Issues"><a href="#5-Phone-Call-and-Touch-Screen-Delay-Issues" class="headerlink" title="5.

The first was an issue with calls: the screen would light up and your ringtone would play, but the answer&#x2F;decline call prompt never appeared.</p><p> Meanwhile, the other issue mostly affected users in cold climates. The iPhone X touchscreen would become unresponsive when encountering a sudden drop in temperature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iphone_x_1.jpg"                      alt="iPhone X"                ></p><p> Apple fixed both of these issues via a software update, so if you’re encountering either make sure you’re running the latest version of iOS under<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> . If you encounter any other issues like this after updating, it’s time to talk to Apple.</p><p> Another touch screen issue you might encounter is the “ghost touch”, where your iPhone performs actions by itself. To resolve this problem,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-ghost-touch-on-iphone/" >a few ghost touch fixes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are available.</p><p> Regardless of your iPhone model, you might also come across problems with text message delivery. But there are easy <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-wont-send-text-messages/" >fixes you can try if your iPhone won’t send messages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="6-Wireless-Charging-Issues"><a href="#6-Wireless-Charging-Issues" class="headerlink" title="6. Wireless Charging Issues"></a>6. Wireless Charging Issues</h2><p> The iPhone X isn’t Apple’s first smartphone to use wireless charging, but it is susceptible to issues from interference. In particular, if you’re wirelessly charging the iPhone X in a folio case, and have credit cards or other cards that use contactless technology, you may encounter interference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/apple_airpower.jpg"                      alt="Apple AirPower"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-BHGGIC0zE?si=FzUQKZa-bx8OlKuB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Try removing the cards if you’re having charging issues. If you’re not using a folio case (or you’ve already removed the cards) then make sure you’re using a high-quality wireless charger.</p><p> Hopefully wireless charging will be <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wanted-features-next-iphone/" >a feature improved on future iPhones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Speakers-Crackling-at-Loud-Volumes"><a href="#7-Speakers-Crackling-at-Loud-Volumes" class="headerlink" title="7. Speakers Crackling at Loud Volumes"></a>7. Speakers Crackling at Loud Volumes</h2><p> Both the iPhone X and iPhone 8 have had reports of crackling speakers, particularly at high volumes. If you haven’t tested your iPhone’s maximum volume yet, it’s a good idea to test it out now to see if you’re affected. Some have described this as a “buzzing” sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iphone_x_4.jpg"                      alt="iPhone X Speaker Array"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNw3Lb26wFA?si=5NR1XRVSp41EQYMy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you do encounter the issue, try updating your software to the latest version.

Keep Your AirPods and iPhone Closer Together</h2><p> This one’s probably obvious, but the further you move away from your iPhone, the higher the chances are that your AirPods won’t stay connected. Keep the distance between you and your paired device under 30 feet, and you should be fine.</p><h2 id="3-Disable-and-Re-Activate-Bluetooth-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#3-Disable-and-Re-Activate-Bluetooth-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3.

Disable and Re-Activate Bluetooth on Your iPhone</h2><p> Disabling and re-activating Bluetooth on your iPhone or other connected device can eliminate minor technical glitches and help fix AirPods-related connectivity issues. The best way to do that is to toggle Airplane Mode on and off.</p><p> Simply swipe down from the top-right of the iPhone’s screen to open the Control Center (or swipe up from the bottom of the screen if the device has a Home button). Then, tap the<strong>Airplane Mode</strong> icon, wait for 10 seconds, and then tap it again to turn Bluetooth back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-airplane-mode-iphone-e1619179705753.jpg"                      alt="Activate Airplane Mode on iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3koT_-kvbks?si=sQV7FzPiz6GYITrE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Charge-Your-AirPods"><a href="#4-Charge-Your-AirPods" class="headerlink" title="4.

Therefore, simply place your AirPods back in the case and charge them sufficiently before using them again.</p><p> If the batteries of your AirPods often die quickly, you may want to review your usage habits to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-airpods-battery-dying/" >prevent your AirPods’ batteries from draining too fast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Disable-Automatic-Ear-Detection"><a href="#5-Disable-Automatic-Ear-Detection" class="headerlink" title="5.

But it can also cause the audio to disconnect, especially if you tend to fidget with the left or the right AirPod while wearing them. If your AirPods don’t stay connected to your iPhone, turning off Automatic Ear Detection can help.</p><p> First, connect your AirPods to your iPhone. Then, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Bluetooth</strong> and tap the<strong>i</strong> icon next to your AirPods.

And when you pair your AirPods to this iPhone, Find My is automatically enabled for the AirPods too. You don’t have to take any other steps.

If you have AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, or AirPods (3rd generation), you can see the location of these missing AirPods inside the Find My app for up to 24 hours after they were last connected to your device.</p><p> Here’s how to enable Find My Network for your AirPods so that you can locate them using the Find My app in the future:</p><ol><li>Connect your AirPods to your iPhone.</li><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone and tap<strong>Bluetooth</strong> .</li><li>Tap the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to your AirPods.</li><li>Enable the switch for<strong>Find My Network</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/settings-menu-in-ios-17.jpg"                      alt="Settings menu in iOS 17"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bluetooth-settings-in-ios.jpg"                      alt="Bluetooth settings in iOS"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/airpods-settings-showing-find-my-network-toggle-in-ios.jpg"                      alt="AirPods settings showing Find My Network toggle in iOS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nl0Z0eth1u4?si=0eecOBNfc--51AJO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-Put-Your-AirPods-in-the-Charging-Case-and-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#3-Put-Your-AirPods-in-the-Charging-Case-and-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3.

Put Your AirPods in the Charging Case and Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> Sometimes, your AirPods might not show up in the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac due to temporary glitches, which can be easily solved by a simple restart.</p><p> To address this, put your AirPods in their charging case and close the lid. Now go ahead and <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restart your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the Apple device you’re checking the Find My app on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=3YDfzJAZMDp1gFRz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Check-Apple’s-System-Status-for-the-Find-My-Service"><a href="#4-Check-Apple’s-System-Status-for-the-Find-My-Service" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Apple’s System Status for the Find My Service"></a>4. Check Apple’s System Status for the Find My Service</h2><p> On rare occasions, the problem may not be on your end but on Apple’s. To check, visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/" >Apple’s System Status page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Here, make sure you see a green circle next to<strong>Apple ID</strong> ,<strong>iCloud Account &amp; Sign In</strong> ,<strong>iCloud Web Apps</strong> , and<strong>Maps</strong> .</p><p> If these services show a yellow or red symbol, it means they’re facing an outage. You’ll need to wait for Apple to fix it. After that, open the Find My app or go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/find/" >iCloud.com&#x2F;find <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to locate your AirPods.</p><h2 id="5-Use-iCloud-com-Instead-of-the-Find-My-App"><a href="#5-Use-iCloud-com-Instead-of-the-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="5. Use iCloud.com Instead of the Find My App"></a>5. Use iCloud.com Instead of the Find My App</h2><p> When you can’t locate your AirPods in the Find My app, try using this service in a browser instead. Here are the steps for that:</p><ol><li>Visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/" >iCloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your Mac, PC, iPad, or iPhone and sign in using your Apple ID.</li><li>Click or tap<strong>Find iPhone</strong> .</li><li>On mobile, you should see your AirPods here.

Ensure Your AirPods Are Charged"></a>6. Ensure Your AirPods Are Charged</h2><p> If your AirPods are dead, they won’t show their location in the Find My app. The most you can see in this situation is their last known location. To charge your AirPods, put them in their charging case. If the case has no battery left, connect it to power.</p><h2 id="7-Find-My-Isn’t-Available-With-a-Managed-Apple-ID"><a href="#7-Find-My-Isn’t-Available-With-a-Managed-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="7. Find My Isn’t Available With a Managed Apple ID"></a>7. Find My Isn’t Available With a Managed Apple ID</h2><p> You won’t have access to Find My while using a managed Apple ID assigned to you by your school, college, or office. As a result, you won’t be able to see your AirPods (or any device) in the Find My app. The solution is to sign in to a personal Apple ID account on your connected device instead.</p><h2 id="8-Unpair-Your-AirPods-and-Pair-Them-Again"><a href="#8-Unpair-Your-AirPods-and-Pair-Them-Again" class="headerlink" title="8. Unpair Your AirPods and Pair Them Again"></a>8. Unpair Your AirPods and Pair Them Again</h2><p> When none of the above fixes work, it’s time to unpair your AirPods and pair them again. These steps will show you how to do that:</p><ol><li>Put the AirPods in their charging case.</li><li>Open your iPhone<strong>Settings</strong> and tap<strong>Bluetooth</strong> .</li><li>Tap the<strong>info (i)</strong> button next to your AirPods.</li><li>Tap<strong>Forget This Device &gt; Forget Device</strong> .</li><li>Restart your iPhone.</li><li>Now,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-connect-airpods-mac-iphone-pc-android/" >pair the AirPods to your device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> again.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iphone-settings-app.PNG"                      alt="iPhone Settings app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/On0Jw2oMZf0?si=Pm-FJoEt8XWmtMbr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iphone-bluetooth-settings-showing-airpods-info-button.PNG"                      alt="iPhone Bluetooth Settings showing AirPods info button"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/forget-this-device-option-in-airpods-bluetooth-settings.PNG"                      alt="Forget This Device option in AirPods Bluetooth Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXUt81WsQpI?si=W3DKIAsa2-qbGadJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="9-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware"><a href="#9-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware" class="headerlink" title="9. Update Your AirPods Firmware"></a>9. Update Your AirPods Firmware</h2><p> Like software updates on your iPhone, AirPods get firmware updates to fix bugs and introduce new features. For example, the October 2021 update added the Find My Network feature to AirPods Pro and Max. Thus, to get the best possible AirPods experience and to fix any problems, learn <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-airpods/" >how to update your AirPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the latest firmware.</p><h2 id="10-Reset-Your-AirPods"><a href="#10-Reset-Your-AirPods" class="headerlink" title="10. Reset Your AirPods"></a>10. Reset Your AirPods</h2><p> Finally, if the issue continues, the penultimate option is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-airpods/" >reset your AirPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This will remove the AirPods from all earlier devices you have paired them with, and you’ll have to connect them again from scratch. Doing this fixes several major problems with the AirPods, including when they don’t show in the Find My app.</p><h2 id="11-Find-My-Won’t-Show-Your-AirPods-if-It’s-Been-Too-Long"><a href="#11-Find-My-Won’t-Show-Your-AirPods-if-It’s-Been-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="11. Find My Won’t Show Your AirPods if It’s Been Too Long"></a>11. Find My Won’t Show Your AirPods if It’s Been Too Long</h2><p> Technically, Find My shows the last known AirPods location, even when their battery dies. But if it’s been a particularly long time, Find My might not show any location for your AirPods, even though it still lists them in the Find My app.</p><p> In the screenshots below, you can see that my old AirPods still show up in the list of devices. But after tapping their name, the map shows no location or relevant details except giving the option to play a sound (which won’t work until the AirPods come online). The only solution for this is to connect and use your AirPods again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/find-my-app-on-iphone-showing-all-added-devices.PNG"                      alt="Find My app on iPhone showing all added devices"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/find-my-app-showing-no-location-for-airpods.PNG"                      alt="Find My app showing no location for AirPods"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaGNHfAT92w?si=bvHo1iYK2JBIPtRo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wy0uYNNdMDM?si=5ir7EHlr0CkpcYOT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Locate-Your-AirPods-in-the-Find-My-App-Again"><a href="#Locate-Your-AirPods-in-the-Find-My-App-Again" class="headerlink" title="Locate Your AirPods in the Find My App Again"></a>Locate Your AirPods in the Find My App Again</h2><p> Since AirPods don’t have network connectivity and rely on your iPhone or another connected device to show up in Find My, it can be pretty tough to find them if they ever go missing.</p><p> Nevertheless, the Find My service is handy and can be used to learn the last known location, get directions, and play sounds from missing devices. All these features make it very worthwhile to add your AirPods to Find My, and the above solutions should ensure they appear correctly.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-download-and-relive-a-compreran-review-of-top-youtube-playlist-extractors/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Download and Relive A Compreran Review of Top YouTube Playlist Extractors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-online-mp3-generator-from-fb-videos-2023-updates/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Quick Online MP3 Generator From FB Videos, 2023 Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-aesthetic-fusion-studio-ultimate-photo-alchemy/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Aesthetic Fusion Studio Ultimate Photo Alchemy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-uncovering-forgotten-facebook-episodes-cross-device-instructions/"><u>[Updated] Uncovering Forgotten Facebook Episodes Cross-Device Instructions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-unleash-your-vision-establishing-an-entrepreneurial-video-haven-on-phone/"><u>2024 Approved Unleash Your Vision Establishing an Entrepreneurial Video Haven on Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/clear-steps-to-correct-the-location-not-available-glitch-on-iphones/"><u>Clear Steps to Correct the 'Location Not Available' Glitch on iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/from-blurry-snaps-to-stunning-shots-learn-lunapic-editing-for-2024/"><u>From Blurry Snaps to Stunning Shots Learn LunaPic Editing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-and-reset-airplay-when-its-broken-down/"><u>How to Repair and Reset AirPlay When It's Broken Down</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-prevent-cross-site-tracking-on-oneplus-nord-3-5g-and-browser-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Prevent Cross-Site Tracking on OnePlus Nord 3 5G and Browser | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/iphone-recovery-techniques-no-need-for-itunes/"><u>IPhone Recovery Techniques: No Need for iTunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/lost-iphone-notifications-revive-them-with-this-expert-guide-of-7-fixes/"><u>Lost iPhone Notifications?

But if this happens too frequently, and there are more mistakes than accurate corrections, here’s what you should do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vca--yEhtdo?si=7ijqjyP-oi3LYze1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Test-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-Screen"><a href="#Test-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Test Your iPhone or iPad Screen"></a>Test Your iPhone or iPad Screen</h3><p> If the on-screen keyboard seems to type on its own and input the wrong letters and words, the issue may lie with your iPhone screen. Test to see if your iPhone works normally when you’re not using the keyboard.</p><p> If your iPhone is also opening apps randomly when you’re not touching the screen at all, this is a problem known as “ghost touch.” You can try solutions such as cleaning your iPhone screen and replacing the screen protector to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-ghost-touch-on-iphone/" >fix ghost touch on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> But if the cause of ghost touch is damaged hardware—for example, you dropped your iPhone recently, and there are visible screen cracks—you probably need to replace your iPhone’s display. While we recommend getting it fixed by Apple, you have <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/places-that-fix-iphone-screens-for-cheap/" >options if you want to fix your iPhone’s screen for cheap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h3 id="Check-Your-Text-Replacement-Setting"><a href="#Check-Your-Text-Replacement-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Check Your Text Replacement Setting"></a>Check Your Text Replacement Setting</h3><p> Let’s say you’re typing the phrase “I’m studying” in a message, but it autocorrects to “I’m napping” every time. This is probably caused by a text replacement setting.</p><p> The purpose of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-text-replacement-on-apple-devices/" >iPhone text replacement is to help people save time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by completing phrases from preset abbreviations. However, it can also be used by a family or friend to set up a prank, hence the endless “correction.”</p><p> Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text Replacement</strong> . If there’s an unwanted phrase in the list, swipe left on it and tap<strong>Delete</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/expanded-iphone-keyboards-setting.PNG"                      alt="expanded iphone keyboards setting"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iphone-text-replacement-setting.PNG"                      alt="iphone text replacement setting"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/removal-of-preset-text-in-iphone-text-replacement-setting.PNG"                      alt="removal of preset text in iphone text replacement setting"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-iPhone-or-iPad-Keyboard-Is-Lagging"><a href="#3-iPhone-or-iPad-Keyboard-Is-Lagging" class="headerlink" title="3. iPhone or iPad Keyboard Is Lagging"></a>3. iPhone or iPad Keyboard Is Lagging</h2><p> If you’re typing swiftly on your iPhone keyboard but the text takes a while to show up on the screen, the cause might be a temporary software glitch or an incorrect iPhone setting.
