However, as time goes by, issues may start to surface, and that’s okay. One of the common issues that can affect your iPhone camera is blurry images. With this, images shot from your iPhone won’t be clear and crisp.</p><p> If you’re facing this issue, various factors could be causing your iPhone’s camera to be blurry. But before rushing to a nearby repair shop, here are different solutions to help you fix your blurry iPhone camera.</p><h2 id="1-Remove-the-Protective-Film-From-Your-Camera-Lens"><a href="#1-Remove-the-Protective-Film-From-Your-Camera-Lens" class="headerlink" title="1. Remove the Protective Film From Your Camera Lens"></a>1. Remove the Protective Film From Your Camera Lens</h2><p> You might have installed a protective film on the camera glass to prevent your iPhone camera lens from being damaged if you accidentally drop your device. Such a move is done in good faith to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/precautions-tips-to-extend-iphone-lifespan/" >extend your iPhone’s lifespan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> However, a protective film might obstruct the light entering your lens if not installed correctly, leading your iPhone to shoot blurry images. This might also be the case if the protective film is scratched. Thankfully, fixing this is easy.</p><p> Remove the protective film, and your problem will be fixed. If the front-facing camera is affected, ensure that your screen protector (if you have one installed) is not obstructing the lens.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/poI1NQxHfjc?si=ZLG0wziYcTKIKwL5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Clean-Your-Camera-Lens"><a href="#2-Clean-Your-Camera-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2.

If there are smudges, dust, or any debris on your iPhone’s camera lenses, images won’t be clear because of the obstruction. You can fix this by cleaning your camera lenses.<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203040" >Apple recommends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you use a dry microfiber cloth to clean your camera lens.</p><p> However, even so, there are cases where this might not work. For example, if there’s debris inside the lens, you have no option but to take your device to an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. You should also do the same if you notice damage to your camera’s protector glass (the glass covering the camera lens).</p><h2 id="3-Keep-Your-Hands-Steady-While-Shooting"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Hands-Steady-While-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Hands Steady While Shooting"></a>3. Keep Your Hands Steady While Shooting</h2><p> Shooting clear images also requires you to be steady. Even if everything else works fine, but your hands are shaky while shooting, your photos will look blurry because of the motion. And camera lenses are specifically sensitive to movement. Keep your hands steady while pressing the Shutter button for the best results.</p><p> You can achieve this by not holding your breath while shooting and ensuring that you press the capture button at the end of exhaling. Using volume buttons instead of the Shutter button to capture can also improve stability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-keep-iphone-camera-night-mode-always-off-in-ios-15.jpg"                      alt="Person taking a photo with an iPhone Pro"                ></p><p> If you struggle with this, you can place your iPhone on a surface, or if you’re ready to spend a few bucks, you can invest in a tripod stand for your iPhone.</p><p> For expert recommendations, check out our roundup of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/whats-best-phone-tripod/" >the best phone tripods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Disable the AE&#x2F;AF Lock"></a>4. Disable the AE&#x2F;AF Lock</h2><p> Auto-exposure (AE) and Auto-focus (AF) features on your iPhone camera are important for setting fixed focus and exposure values. AE&#x2F;AF ensures that your device always retains the exposure and focus on the subject. Even if you change the distance between you and the subject by either walking towards or away from it, your device will not refocus.</p><p> This is perfect as long as you remain in the same position. But if the distance between your device and the subject changes, the AE&#x2F;AF lock will cause your images to look blurry. If the feature is enabled, you’ll see a yellow box with<strong>AE&#x2F;AF Lock</strong> in your camera’s view.</p><p><img src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/aeaf-lock-enabled-iphone.jpg" alt="AE/AF Lock enabled on iPhone"></p><p><img src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/aeaf-lock-disabled-ios.jpg" alt="AE/AF Lock disabled on iPhone"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6Wfzj6YNDM?si=WRZQD9zCdQ1_tW1b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> You can turn it off by tapping anywhere in the camera preview. This will ensure that your iPhone automatically refocuses when you or the subject moves. You should also explore more <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-camera-settings/" >iPhone camera settings for taking better photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Reduce-Zoom-Levels"><a href="#5-Reduce-Zoom-Levels" class="headerlink" title="5. Reduce Zoom Levels"></a>5. Reduce Zoom Levels</h2><p> Another reason that could lead to blurry photos on iPhone is if you’ve zoomed in. Depending on your iPhone model, you may have access to different zoom levels. If, for example, you have the iPhone 15 Pro, you have access to 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom. For the iPhone 14 Pro, optical zoom is capped at 3x, whereas digital zoom is capped at 15x.</p><p> But the more you zoom in, the more your images lose details. Images will lose their sharpness and become blurry at maximum zoom levels. If you’ve zoomed in, reduce the zoom until you can capture the image without quality degradation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/zoomed-in-view-iphone-camera.jpg"                      alt="Zoomed-in view in iOS Camera app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPoakxUNf9o?si=S-ppSqzHzN9VrxC7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/standard-view-iphone-camera.jpg"                      alt="Standard view in iOS Camera app"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> We recommend using optical zoom instead of digital zoom to get the best results. You can see this by tapping the number at the bottom of your image preview with the Camera app open. You can pinch out with two fingers to slightly increase the level to a point where the image still looks detailed. However, just remember that while digital zoom gives you a better range, the quality won’t be nearly as good.</p><h2 id="6-Remove-Accessories-From-Your-iPhone"><a href="#6-Remove-Accessories-From-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="6. Remove Accessories From Your iPhone"></a>6. Remove Accessories From Your iPhone</h2><p> If you have magnetic or metallic accessories on your iPhone, they might interfere with your camera’s ability to focus. Common culprits include phone cases and camera accessories like a magnetic lens mount or a lens converter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-with-moment-lens-case.jpg"                      alt="iPhone covered in case with moment macro lens attached"                ></p><p> These accessories commonly cause motion blur in low-light situations, according to Apple. So, remove the accessories and try taking a photo, then see if the issue has been fixed. If this fixes your blurry iPhone camera, remove the accessory whenever you want to shoot.</p><h2 id="7-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#7-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="7. Restart Your iPhone"></a>7. Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> As a last resort, you should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restart your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . iOS, despite its refinement, is never perfect; you’ll occasionally encounter glitches and bugs. So, if none of the solutions above have fixed your problem, try restarting your device.</p><p> You might not be a believer in this catch-all solution, but it’s been proven that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-restarting-smartphone-fixes-most-problems/" >restarting fixes most smartphone problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Go ahead and do it, then <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/alternate-ways-to-open-iphone-camera/" >open your iPhone’s Camera app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> again and check if your problem is fixed.</p><h2 id="Take-Clear-Pictures-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Take-Clear-Pictures-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Take Clear Pictures on Your iPhone"></a>Take Clear Pictures on Your iPhone</h2><p> Taking clear images on your iPhone requires the software and hardware to be in great condition or set up correctly. If your iPhone’s camera has been taking blurry pictures, try all the solutions above.</p><p> If all else fails and you’re confident you haven’t damaged your iPhone’s camera, you should contact Apple support. An expert should be able to provide a concrete answer for your troubles. They might even recommend a camera repair or replacement if it’s a factory defect.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-value-airborne-innovations-top-5-budget-drone-selections/"><u>[New] Value Airborne Innovations Top 5 Budget Drone Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721481099531-airplay-not-working-heres-how-you-can-fix-it/"><u>AirPlay Not Working?

Despite the fact that you can’t physically open your AirPods or go into the settings on the diminutive headphones, there are still plenty of troubleshooting steps you can take to fix audio issues.</p><p> So, before you spend a bunch of time chatting to Apple’s technical support, here’s how to fix AirPods sound problems for yourself.</p><h2 id="1-Update-Your-iPhone-iPad-or-Mac"><a href="#1-Update-Your-iPhone-iPad-or-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Update Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac"></a>1. Update Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac</h2><p> The first step you should take is to update the operating system for whatever device your AirPods are paired to, be it an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Android device, or Windows PC.</p><p> These updates are the best way to fix widespread bugs that have emerged, which might be causing the problems with your AirPods. Just use the relevant link below to learn how to update your device:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >Update an iPhone or iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-apple-watch/" >Update an Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-mac-software/" >Update a Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-your-android-phone/" >Update an Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-windows-software-guide/" >Update a Windows PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="2-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware"><a href="#2-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is a little trickier to do because there’s no “Update Firmware” button. Instead, follow our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-airpods/" >update the firmware on your AirPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Check the Accessibility Audio Balance"></a>3. Check the Accessibility Audio Balance</h2><p> If you need to fix your AirPods because the sound is louder on one side, it might actually be the result of a feature, rather than a bug. Take a moment to learn about <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-disable-dynamic-head-tracking-iphone/" >Dynamic Head Tracking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which moves the sound in your AirPods as you turn your head so that it always sounds like it’s coming from your paired device.</p><p> If you’ve ruled out Dynamic Head Tracking, there might be an issue with your Accessibility settings:</p><ol><li>Pair your AirPods to an iPhone or iPad and go to<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio&#x2F;Visual</strong> .</li><li>Scroll down to<strong>Balance</strong> .</li><li>Ensure the slider is set to<strong>0.00</strong> in the middle.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/General-settings-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="General settings on iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Accssibility-settings-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Accssibility settings on iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AudioVisual-settings-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Audio:Visual settings on iPhone"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtylXDY9YfA?si=VonzSiDFGCpJm2uC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Recharge-Your-AirPods-and-Charging-Case"><a href="#4-Recharge-Your-AirPods-and-Charging-Case" class="headerlink" title="4.

This could be caused by a weak signal or interference from other devices and appliances. To troubleshoot your Bluetooth connection, make sure your AirPods are close to the device they’re paired with. Stay in the same room, and try not to let any big object get in between the two.</p><p> If your audio is still glitchy, try moving away from any objects that might interfere with your Bluetooth connection. These could include:</p><ul><li>Poorly shielded cables</li><li>Microwaves</li><li>Wi-Fi routers</li></ul><p> Lastly, try using the AirPods with a different device to see if the Bluetooth problems were with your original device, rather than the AirPods. Needless to say, if your AirPods audio is glitchy no matter which device you use them with, then you know that you’re dealing with an AirPods problem.</p><p> If you do discover that one particular device is causing problems with your AirPods, try disconnecting any other Bluetooth devices from it (including an Apple Watch), then try toggling Bluetooth on and off or resetting the device entirely to fix it.</p><h2 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Wi-Fi-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Wi-Fi-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9.

Siri Can’t Hear You or Doesn’t Understand What You Say"></a>4. Siri Can’t Hear You or Doesn’t Understand What You Say</h2><p> If Siri doesn’t always hear you or frequently misunderstands what you say, there might be a problem with your iPhone or iPad’s microphones. Sometimes, you can fix that by cleaning the microphones with a dry, soft-bristled brush or by removing your screen protector and case.</p><p> There are multiple microphones on your iPhone or iPad. You can test each of them by recording a short video or audio snippets in different apps:</p><ul><li>To test the primary microphone at the bottom of your device, open the<strong>Voice Memos</strong> app and tap the red button to record a short message. Listen to the playback and make sure you can hear it clearly.</li><li>To test the front microphone, open the<strong>Camera</strong> app and film a short video using the front-facing camera. Replay the video to make sure you can hear it clearly.</li><li>To test the rear microphone, open the<strong>Camera</strong> app and film a short video using the rear camera. Replay the video to make sure you can hear it clearly.</li></ul><p> If one of them isn’t working properly, you can try a few <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-microphone-fixes/" >solutions to fix your iPhone’s microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or contact <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/contact" >Apple Support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to arrange a repair.

Siri Doesn’t Say Anything When Asked a Question</h2><p> We usually expect to hear a spoken response after asking Siri a question or issuing a command. If that doesn’t happen, there might be a problem with the settings on your iPhone. Other times, it’s as simple as turning the volume up.</p><p> Make sure Siri is set to reply to you by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search &gt; Siri Responses &gt; Prefer Spoken Responses</strong> . To turn up Siri’s volume, repeatedly press the<strong>Volume Up</strong> button while using Siri. If you adjust the volume at other times, it might not affect Siri’s volume at all—see <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-volume-not-working-like-it-should/" >more iPhone volume troubleshooting tips <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for an explanation.</p><p> If Siri still doesn’t say anything, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search &gt; Siri Voice</strong> .

Usually, Siri says, “I’m having trouble connecting” or “Try again in a little while” when this happens.</p><p> Make sure your device is connected to Wi-Fi and try streaming a YouTube video to test your internet connection.

First,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/close-apps-on-ipad-iphone/" >close all open apps on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Then try to see if Siri works when the app is reopened. Another general fix is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restart your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and, if available, update to a newer version of iOS. Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> to do so.</p><p> Finally, you can try resetting all settings on your iPhone by going to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset</strong> and choosing<strong>Reset All Settings</strong> . This doesn’t delete any apps or media from your device, but it reverts all settings to their default state. Once the reset is complete, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search</strong> to turn Siri on again.</p><p> With these various solutions, we hope you managed to fix all your Siri problems by now. Most of the fixes involve checking that you have the correct iPhone settings in place for Siri to work the way you prefer.</p><p> Even with the right settings, it’s not uncommon for software glitches to happen. In such cases, all you need to do is reset Siri, and you should be able to use the virtual assistant on your iPhone or iPad again.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-quick-click-compilation-top-10-fastest-phone-and-pc-apps/"><u>[New] Quick Click Compilation Top 10 Fastest Phone & PC Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-pinnacle-of-intellect-trivia-videos/"><u>[Updated] Pinnacle of Intellect Trivia Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/cing-creativity-and-logic-in-gaming-videos/"><u>Balancing Creativity and Logic in Gaming Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/cant-access-the-contact-list-on-your-iphone-here-are-three-reliable-repairs/"><u>Can't Access the Contact List on Your iPhone?

Your iPhone can show time by displaying it on the clock face of your choice, your preferred widgets, notifications, Live Activities, and other helpful data when it is in StandBy.</p><p> However, many users are having difficulty getting the StandBy feature to work properly on their iPhones. If you’re experiencing a similar problem, you’ve come to the right place, as we’ll discuss a few troubleshooting steps you can follow when StandBy doesn’t work on your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3Th6oa_isA?si=TTQ013BB9beUM4x6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-if-StandBy-Is-Enabled"><a href="#1-Check-if-StandBy-Is-Enabled" class="headerlink" title="1. Check if StandBy Is Enabled"></a>1. Check if StandBy Is Enabled</h2><p> Before we get into advanced troubleshooting methods, let’s start with a basic solution: making sure StandBy is enabled. If you haven’t enabled StandBy in your iPhone’s settings or accidentally turned it off, it won’t work.</p><p> To check if StandBy is enabled on your iPhone, launch the<strong>Settings</strong> app and tap the<strong>StandBy</strong> option from the menu. Turn on the toggle next to<strong>StandBy</strong> if it isn’t already enabled. Now, see if it works as intended. If not, refer to the other methods.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iphone-settings-standby-option.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Settings StandBy option"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iphone-standby-settings.jpg"                      alt="iPhone StandBy Settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> It’s worth mentioning that only the iPhone 14 Pro models that support <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/turn-off-always-on-display-iphone/" >the always-on display feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can show StandBy at all times. So, if you have an older iPhone, you have to manually access StandBy by tapping on the screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=heERQcpMi77lqToE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Make-Sure-You’re-Using-StandBy-Correctly"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-You’re-Using-StandBy-Correctly" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Sure You’re Using StandBy Correctly"></a>2. Make Sure You’re Using StandBy Correctly</h2><p> If StandBy is still not working, it could be because you’re not using it properly. To use StandBy correctly, connect your iPhone to power and put it down in landscape orientation at an inclined angle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/iphone-in-standby-mode-1.jpg"                      alt="iPhone in StandBy Mode"                ></p><p> If you do everything right, it should start working as intended, after which you can personalize StandBy on your iPhone by changing the Photos view, clock style, or even adding widgets.</p><h2 id="3-Use-an-MFi-Certified-Charging-Accessory"><a href="#3-Use-an-MFi-Certified-Charging-Accessory" class="headerlink" title="3.

That’s because if it’s not MFi-certified, you might occasionally get the<strong>This accessory may not be supported</strong> pop-up.</p><p> Although Apple doesn’t require you to use an MFi-certified charger, we highly recommend it, especially when StandBy fails to activate on your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-ssCD10v2M?si=WVWGNayUiCAkMZzZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="4.

Simply turning your iPhone off and turning it back on is one of the easiest ways to fix any software issue you could be facing with your device. Therefore, a simple restart is also a potential fix when StandBy isn’t working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iphone-slide-to-power-off.jpg"                      alt="iPhone slide to power off"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZVDkvMZvP4?si=xAugrCf-Ud6EMMpm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> However, if you’re still out of luck after a reboot, you should contact Apple Support or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-store-appointment-genius-bar/" >make an Apple Store appointment at a Genius Bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for in-person assistance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPoakxUNf9o?si=S-ppSqzHzN9VrxC7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Enjoy-StandBy-in-All-Its-Glory"><a href="#Enjoy-StandBy-in-All-Its-Glory" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy StandBy in All Its Glory"></a>Enjoy StandBy in All Its Glory</h2><p> We hope one of these troubleshooting steps helped you finally get StandBy to work on your iPhone as intended. Take advantage of StandBy when your iPhone is simply lying on your desk.</p><p> Even when you’re not actively using your iPhone, iOS 17’s StandBy feature lets you quickly check any information that might be important or glance at the time without having to press any button or raise your iPhone. But that’s not to say the feature doesn’t have its fair share of annoying quirks.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-movies-that-spark-inner-strength-and-determination/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Movies That Spark Inner Strength & Determination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-guide-to-ipados-screen-capture/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Guide to iPadOS Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/new-top-live-broadcast-tech-for-industry-experts/"><u>[New] Top Live Broadcast Tech for Industry Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-smoothly-embed-facebook-live-on-your-site/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Smoothly Embed Facebook Live on Your Site</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-voice-versus-video-making-the-right-media-selection-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Voice Versus Video Making the Right Media Selection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/bright-ideas-for-fixing-an-unresponsive-iphone-torch-in-just-12-steps/"><u>Bright Ideas for Fixing an Unresponsive iPhone Torch in Just 12 Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-issues-when-your-iphone-fails-to-backup-on-icloud-top-9-methods/"><u>How to Resolve Issues When Your iPhone Fails to Backup on iCloud – Top 9 Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-retrieve-deleted-facetime-pictures-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/"><u>How to Retrieve Deleted FaceTime Pictures on Your iPhone or iPad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-oppo-find-x7-ultra-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Bypassing Google Account With vnROM Bypass For Oppo Find X7 Ultra</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/master-the-art-of-iphone-battery-maintenance-with-these-6-straightforward-steps/"><u>Master the Art of iPhone Battery Maintenance with These 6 Straightforward Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/solving-your-iphone-wi-fi-sharing-issues-a-step-by-step-fix-for-non-working-hotspot-feature/"><u>Solving Your iPhone Wi-Fi Sharing Issues - A Step-by-Step Fix for Non-Working Hotspot Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-steps-getting-your-airplay-back-on-track/"><u>Troubleshooting Steps: Getting Your AirPlay Back on Track</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-your-disabled-iphone-12-pro-without-itunes-in-5-ways-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Unlock Your Disabled iPhone 12 Pro Without iTunes in 5 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/xbox-360-mp4/"><u>Xbox 360 MP4動画再生ガイド - 不具合があったらどう対応?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

What’s the point of dialing from your phone if you are getting facilities to call and message people without extra charges?</p><p> You might not notice that your iPhone has lost the SIM connection until it’s actually needed. iPhone 12 might lose its connection to a SIM card due to a glitch in an update, a damaged SIM or port, improper tray placement, or a malfunction in the iOS system.</p><p>Before taking it to the nearest Apple Store, try these steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-on-iPhone-1.JPG"                      alt="Airplane mode on iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AGmFrtBLHw?si=VhvpUaXHPBHl6OT6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-off-1.JPG"                      alt="Airplane mode off"                ></p><p>Close</p><ol><li>Confirm that your SIM card is active and ready to use.</li><li>Activate Airplane Mode on the phone and turn it off.

On rare occasions, however, those options may not work. Before you search for the nearest Apple repair center, you should try to restore your iPhone using DFU mode instead.</p><p> In this article, we’ll check out how to put your iPhone in DFU mode and also how to exit this mode.</p><h2 id="What-Is-DFU-Mode"><a href="#What-Is-DFU-Mode" class="headerlink" title="What Is DFU Mode?"></a>What Is DFU Mode?</h2><p> DFU stands for Device Firmware Update, and this is a special mode built into the Apple mobile operating system (iOS). It is an advanced recovery mode, as it fixes problems that are found in the firmware as well as the software.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restart-iphone-recovery-mode/" >How to Force Restart an iPhone and Enter Recovery Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In this mode, your iOS device is powered on, but your operating system isn’t booted up, so you can alter the operating system. Here, your device will interact with Finder or iTunes on a Mac or Windows computer without it automatically updating your iOS version.</p><p> Using DFU mode, you can upgrade or downgrade your iOS version, update from a beta version, and jailbreak your iPhone—or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-restore-jailbroken-iphone-ipad-stock-right-way/" >un-jailbreak your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> This is a useful last-resort fix to rule out software problems, and it’s an effective way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-iphone-stuck-apple-logo/" >restore a device that is stuck on Apple’s logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , buggy, or unresponsive. Entering this mode is tricky, though, as it requires precise timing and multiple steps.</p><p> But don’t fret. If you follow the detailed instructions in the sections below, you’ll be able to use DFU mode successfully.</p><h2 id="Does-DFU-Mode-Delete-iPhone-Data"><a href="#Does-DFU-Mode-Delete-iPhone-Data" class="headerlink" title="Does DFU Mode Delete iPhone Data?"></a>Does DFU Mode Delete iPhone Data?</h2><p> Unfortunately, if you use this mode to install something or restore your device, all of your iPhone’s data will be erased. This works similarly to the iTunes restore method, which also deletes all of your data.</p><p> It completely erases your iPhone, erasing all of your videos, photos, messages, apps, and even the previously configured settings. When you’re finished with this mode, you’ll have to reset your device to use it. We recommend backing up your files before entering DFU mode, then restoring them after the process.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restore-iphone-ipad-from-backup/" >How to Restore Your iPhone or iPad From a Backup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Enter-DFU-Mode-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Enter-DFU-Mode-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Enter DFU Mode on Your iPhone"></a>How to Enter DFU Mode on Your iPhone</h2><p>Before you begin:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-iphone-ipad/" >Back up your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if possible, as a DFU restore will erase your iPhone data.</li><li>Install the latest version of iTunes or macOS on your Windows or Mac.</li><li>Do not disconnect your iPhone when iTunes or Finder is actively reinstalling the system software and firmware.</li><li>Do not try to use DFU mode to restore a device that is water damaged, as this simply won’t work.</li></ul><p> It is necessary to note that using DFU mode to downgrade iOS or jailbreak your device can cause damage and void the warranty.</p><p> Entering DFU mode involves a combination of pressing, holding, and releasing different buttons on your iPhone. You will also need a compatible USB cable to connect the device to a Mac or a Windows PC running the latest version of macOS or iTunes.</p><p> The key combinations for entering DFU mode differ depending on your iPhone model. Rest assured, no matter which iPhone you’ve got, we have specific instructions for you to activate DFU mode on your device.</p><h3 id="How-to-Enter-DFU-Mode-on-an-iPhone-8-or-Later"><a href="#How-to-Enter-DFU-Mode-on-an-iPhone-8-or-Later" class="headerlink" title="How to Enter DFU Mode on an iPhone 8 or Later"></a>How to Enter DFU Mode on an iPhone 8 or Later</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omar-al-ghosson-qSnlkqPCj-4-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="Face down iPhone 8"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6X24fPKs6AE?si=YtQy-8zy7GifgfA7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Follow these steps to enter DFU mode on an iPhone 8 or later:</p><ol><li>Connect your iPhone to a Windows PC or Mac with the USB cable.</li><li>Open the iTunes or Finder app.</li><li>Press and quickly release the<strong>Volume up</strong> button.</li><li>Press and quickly release the<strong>Volume down</strong> button.</li><li>Press and hold the<strong>Side&#x2F;Power</strong> button for about 10 seconds until the screen goes black.</li><li>Keep holding the<strong>Side&#x2F;Power</strong> button and also press the<strong>Volume down</strong> button for about 5 seconds.</li><li>Release the<strong>Side&#x2F;Power</strong> button, but continue holding the<strong>Volume down</strong> button.</li><li>Release the<strong>Volume down</strong> button when you see<strong>iTunes&#x2F;Finder has detected an iPhone in recovery mode</strong> message in your iTunes app.</li><li>Click on<strong>Restore iPhone</strong> to install a new OS.</li></ol><p> If your iPhone displays a screen with a connect to iTunes prompt, then you have to repeat the process.

However, there are instances when some or all of your contact names don’t show up on your iPhone.</p><p> If contacts aren’t showing up on your iPhone, you can use this guide as a fix. But before we dive into the different options, remember that various problems can make your iPhone contacts disappear.</p><p> And therefore, there are various solutions that you can use to fix it. So, try each of these methods and see which one helps to restore contacts on your iPhone.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your iPhone"></a>1. Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> One of the first steps you should try is restarting your iPhone. Sometimes when mobile devices run for a while, they may run into issues. Restarting your iPhone will help give it a fresh start and thus may help fix minor issues you’re facing, including contacts not showing up, sluggish performance, app crashes, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/f4c650853e8507f493dd5a4da625f53ce5ecb8f26fcbb71888c8a6af3708b00c.jpg"                      alt="Person using iPhone"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-restarting-smartphone-fixes-most-problems/" >Restarting can fix most smartphone problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and that’s why the first question a tech support agent asks is, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?”</p><p> There are different ways to restart your iPhone, depending on the model. Read our dedicated guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >how to restart any iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for step-by-step instructions. Once your iPhone is back up and running, confirm if your contacts have been restored. If not, move on to step number two.</p><h2 id="2-Resync-Your-Contacts-With-iCloud"><a href="#2-Resync-Your-Contacts-With-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2. Resync Your Contacts With iCloud"></a>2. Resync Your Contacts With iCloud</h2><p> You could also fix this issue by resyncing your Contacts app with iCloud. We’ll do this by disabling iCloud access to Contacts and then re-enabling it again.

Once your iPhone restores all the contacts, you can delete the fake information you added to the contact above. Check if your contacts have been restored after a few minutes. If this doesn’t solve your issue, try data recovery tools.</p><h2 id="7-Recover-Lost-Data-Using-iCloud-or-Data-Recovery-Tools"><a href="#7-Recover-Lost-Data-Using-iCloud-or-Data-Recovery-Tools" class="headerlink" title="7.

You can do this by going to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/" >iCloud website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Click the card with your account name, then select the<strong>Data Recovery</strong> option at the top of the page.</p><p> If you’re accessing the website on mobile, tap the hamburger menu in the top-left first, then choose<strong>Data Recovery</strong> from the context menu. Next, select<strong>Restore Contacts</strong> . You’ll then have to select an archive to restore.</p><p> You need to have an archive of your contacts that you can restore. If you’ve never archived your contacts in the past, there won’t be any to restore.</p><p> If that doesn’t work, you can try using third-party <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/data-recovery-work/" >data recovery tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to restore your contacts.

However, you’ll have to spend some cash to get it.</p><h2 id="8-Seek-the-Help-of-Apple-Support"><a href="#8-Seek-the-Help-of-Apple-Support" class="headerlink" title="8.

It can happen to you, but when it does, don’t panic. There are a variety of ways to fix the problem. In summary, you could restart your iPhone, resync with iCloud, show all contacts in your Phone app, add all accounts to your iPhone, modify account settings, or force rebuild your contacts.</p><p> If none of these solutions work for you, you can try restoring lost contacts from your iCloud backups. If that fails, make sure to contact Apple’s support team. Using third-party data recovery tools should be your last resort, as you will certainly have to pay for it. Hopefully, one of the free methods works for you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-discover-the-power-of-proportions-in-youtube-content-creation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Discover the Power of Proportions in YouTube Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-fb-cover-video-guide-key-information-for-success/"><u>[Updated] FB Cover Video Guide Key Information for Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/8-proven-techniques-to-resolve-your-iphones-unwanted-headphone-connectivity-issue/"><u>8 Proven Techniques to Resolve Your iPhone's Unwanted Headphone Connectivity Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/essential-peaceful-pc-game-list-for-2024/"><u>Essential Peaceful PC Game List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-black-screen-of-death-on-an-iphone/"><u>How to Fix the Black Screen of Death on an iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-up-your-social-game-apply-tiktoks-best-to-instagram-reels/"><u>In 2024, Step Up Your Social Game Apply TikTok's Best to Instagram Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/master-the-craft-of-gaming-permanent-solutions-for-witcher-3-pc-glitches/"><u>Master the Craft of Gaming: Permanent Solutions for Witcher 3 PC Glitches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/pro-level-drone-racing-techniques-and-quintessential-fpvs-for-2024/"><u>Pro-Level Drone Racing Techniques & Quintessential FPVs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-advanced.techidaily.com/secure-your-windows-system-comprehensive-virus-scan-tutorial-by-yl-software-experts/"><u>Secure Your Windows System: Comprehensive Virus Scan Tutorial by YL Software Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/step-by-step-troubleshooting-techniques-for-iphone-blackout-crisis/"><u>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Techniques for iPhone Blackout Crisis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-iphones-fix-the-persistent-no-more-lines-error-effectively/"><u>Troubleshoot iPhones: Fix the Persistent No More Lines Error Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-iphone-extended-sleep-mode-duration-quick-fixes/"><u>Troubleshooting iPhone: Extended Sleep Mode Duration - Quick Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-itunesfinder-solutions-when-they-cant-detect-your-iphone/"><u>Troubleshooting iTunes/Finder: Solutions When They Can't Detect Your iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-methods-for-error-4013-in-iphones-update-and-restore-solutions/"><u>Troubleshooting Methods for Error 4013 in iPhones: Update and Restore Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-special.techidaily.com/wie-daten-von-alt-ipod-touch-auf-neues-modell-ubertragen/"><u>Wie Daten Von Alt-iPod Touch Auf Neues Modell Übertragen?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Your device will still receive phone calls in Lost Mode, but it won’t display any alerts.</p><p> To enable Lost Mode, select your device in Find My and hit<strong>Activate</strong> under the<strong>Mark As Lost</strong> option.

However, you should only use this option if you never expect to find your missing device again.</p><p> Once you use Find My to erase a missing iPhone, you can’t track its location anymore. No one else can use your device because it’s locked to your Apple ID with Activation Lock.

Otherwise, you’ll notice that the erase is pending on Find My.</p><p> Apple’s Find My app makes locating a lost or stolen iPhone easy. But this isn’t the only tool at your disposal.

You’ll need to use this function if your iPhone runs into major problems. But it’s not always clear how to put an iPhone in recovery mode, especially since the process differs across devices.</p><p> We’ll show you how to put your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch in recovery mode, no matter which model you have.</p><h2 id="Force-Restarting-and-iPhone-Recovery-Mode-Explained"><a href="#Force-Restarting-and-iPhone-Recovery-Mode-Explained" class="headerlink" title="Force Restarting and iPhone Recovery Mode Explained"></a>Force Restarting and iPhone Recovery Mode Explained</h2><p> You hopefully won’t need to force restart your iPhone often, and should rarely have to put it in recovery mode. But it’s important to know for those occasions when something goes wrong.</p><p> When your device becomes completely unresponsive and you can’t shut it down with the usual method, instead of waiting for the battery to deplete, you can initiate a force restart. A force restart is equivalent to pulling a desktop computer’s power plug, as it forces your iPhone to shut down and start up again.</p><p> Recovery mode takes this a step further, putting your device into a state where you can reinstall iOS by connecting your iPhone to a computer running iTunes (or using Finder on macOS Catalina and newer). If <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-iphone-stuck-apple-logo/" >your iPhone refuses to boot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , crashes on startup, or gets stuck on the Apple logo for a long time, you’ll need to put the device into recovery mode in order to rescue it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/iPhone-Recovery-Mode.jpg"                      alt="The recovery mode image shown on an iPhone"                ></p><p> Note that when you reinstall iOS, you’ll lose all the data on your iPhone. This isn’t a problem if you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-iphone-ipad/" >make regular iPhone backups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which you can do using iCloud or locally in iTunes or Finder. Unfortunately, you can’t back up your device in recovery mode, since the process will only offer to restore the firmware.</p><p> As such, if you are stuck with an iPhone that won’t boot and you don’t have <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restore-iphone-ipad-from-backup/" >a backup to restore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , there’s nothing you can do to save your data. You’ll have to proceed with these steps and then start fresh.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-SCWTWpegY?si=oxTsHQkIu1v4-I6b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Enter-Recovery-Mode-on-iPhone-8-iPhone-X-iPhone-13-and-Newer"><a href="#How-to-Enter-Recovery-Mode-on-iPhone-8-iPhone-X-iPhone-13-and-Newer" class="headerlink" title="How to Enter Recovery Mode on iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone 13, and Newer"></a>How to Enter Recovery Mode on iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone 13, and Newer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC05683.jpg"                      alt="iPhone 13 Mini - One hand navigation"                ></p><p> The iPhone 8 and later, including every iPhone model with Face ID, all use the same set of steps to force restart and enter recovery mode.

One such issue is the dreaded low memory warning that affects some iPhone users. But what exactly is this error, and how can you fix it? Here’s everything you need to know.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdlXe5RELW0?si=Iz1H1QnLQVw-Eu3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-Warning"><a href="#What-Is-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-Warning" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Roblox Low Memory Warning?"></a>What Is the Roblox Low Memory Warning?</h2><p> Roblox throws a low memory warning when your iPhone runs low on memory. When this warning appears, you’ll see the following message on the screen:</p><blockquote><p>Your device’s memory is low. Leaving now will preserve your state and prevent Roblox from crashing. (Error Code:292)</p></blockquote><p> Roblox developers recommend leaving the game immediately when this error appears. Doing so ensures that your state is saved and your Roblox avatar is in the position of your choice before you leave the game. You can also choose to keep playing the game, but the probability is very high that the game will crash automatically after a few seconds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLlpdv0cz_k?si=HwTdnMmeVJXm4GPV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Troubleshooting-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-iPhone-Warning"><a href="#Troubleshooting-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-iPhone-Warning" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting the Roblox Low Memory iPhone Warning"></a>Troubleshooting the Roblox Low Memory iPhone Warning</h2><p> The Roblox low memory warning usually appears as a temporary glitch and can be easily fixed by restarting the game. However, if you encounter this issue frequently, you can try some of the troubleshooting steps we’ve outlined below.</p><h3 id="1-Check-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#1-Check-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Device Compatibility"></a>1. Check Device Compatibility</h3><p> You will regularly encounter the low memory warning on Roblox if your device is not fully compatible with the game. An iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, or later is required to play Roblox.</p><p> Additionally, it’s worth <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >updating your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you haven’t already to avoid iOS-related bugs from causing the low memory warning.</p><h3 id="2-Close-Unnecessary-Background-Apps"><a href="#2-Close-Unnecessary-Background-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2. Close Unnecessary Background Apps"></a>2. Close Unnecessary Background Apps</h3><p> Another way to fix the Roblox low memory warning is to close any unnecessary apps running in the background. Apps running in the background can constantly use device memory, leaving foreground apps like Roblox with limited memory. This is especially common on older iPhones, such as the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which only have 1GB of RAM.</p><p> So, close all unnecessary apps running in the background and see if that resolves the Roblox low memory issue.</p><h3 id="3-Reduce-In-Game-Graphics"><a href="#3-Reduce-In-Game-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="3.

Touches may register in the wrong locations, and physical buttons may refuse to work.</p><p> The Home Screen or an app could become non-interactive. With a frozen iPhone—different from an iPhone stuck in a boot loop—standard troubleshooting steps will only take you so far.</p><p> But worry not; you’ve come to the right place to seek advice. Follow along with us as we show how to fix a frozen or unresponsive iPhone.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-to-Do-if-My-iPhone-Freezes-Try-Force-Quitting-Apps"><a href="#What-to-Do-if-My-iPhone-Freezes-Try-Force-Quitting-Apps" class="headerlink" title="What to Do if My iPhone Freezes? Try Force Quitting Apps"></a>What to Do if My iPhone Freezes? Try Force Quitting Apps</h2><p> If a specific app is causing your iPhone to freeze, force quitting the app can resolve the issue most of the time.</p><ul><li><strong>iPhones with Face ID:</strong> Swipe up from the bottom edge and stop near the middle of the screen, then swipe up on the app to close it.</li><li><strong>iPhones with the Home button:</strong> Double-click the Home button to show the App Switcher, then swipe up on the app to close it.</li></ul><p> Upon identifying the app causing the freezing, reinstall it. To do this, press and hold its app icon until a context menu appears, then tap on<strong>Remove App</strong> and choose<strong>Delete</strong> to confirm.</p><p> Doing so will also delete any app settings from the device that might be causing issues. You can now redownload a fresh copy of the app from the App Store. If the iPhone display remains frozen and generally unresponsive, the next troubleshooting step is a force restart.</p><h2 id="Force-Restarting-May-Unfreeze-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Force-Restarting-May-Unfreeze-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Force Restarting May Unfreeze Your iPhone"></a>Force Restarting May Unfreeze Your iPhone</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/apple-iphone-face-id-touch-id-force-restart-button-presses.jpg"                      alt="Illustration showing button press combinations to force-restart iPhones with Face ID and older models"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3PFn06LijE?si=zHrmlTOzrKxXe-k4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/force-restart-iphone-iph8903c3ee6/ios" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Does your iPhone not display a shutdown screen at all?

The problem is that a fully frozen iPhone may not even let you reach the shutdown screen.

Plus, you can go to the Control Center and boost the brightness all the way up and make the battery drain faster.</p><p> With the battery depleted and your iPhone powered down, wait at least 30 seconds before plugging it back into power. The device will start up automatically after a few minutes, as soon as the battery has enough charge for booting. But if draining the battery makes no difference, try putting a frozen iPhone into Recovery Mode.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-a-Frozen-iPhone-With-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#How-to-Fix-a-Frozen-iPhone-With-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix a Frozen iPhone With Recovery Mode"></a>How to Fix a Frozen iPhone With Recovery Mode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ios-downgrade-iphone-recovery-mode-restore-pop-up.jpg"                      alt="an image showing the pop up that appears when mac discovers an iphone in recovery mode"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/HT201263" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Entering Recovery Mode allows you to restore your iPhone from an iCloud or iTunes backup, which may fix the frozen iPhone without deleting any apps or settings.

If Apple has stopped the production of an accessory, it may become incompatible with the devices still on the market.</li></ul><p> Now, let’s go through some ways to fix the “accessory not supported” error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyGoQi7hsZk?si=8OcKcPUj2wSBmVZ1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Unplug-and-Reconnect-the-Device"><a href="#1-Unplug-and-Reconnect-the-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Unplug and Reconnect the Device"></a>1. Unplug and Reconnect the Device</h2><p> One of the first fixes to try when your accessory is not supported is to unplug and reconnect the accessory.</p><p> Tap the<strong>Dismiss</strong> button to clear the alert and pull the accessory out of your iPhone’s Lightning port. Then, plug it back in to see if the same alert appears.</p><p> If it continues to show up, disconnect any other accessories currently connected to your iPhone. For example, you may have AirPods connected via Bluetooth, and now you want to connect your iPhone to your PC with a cable.</p><p> Connecting your iPhone to multiple accessories may be the reason for this temporary error. So, remove your accessories and reconnect them one at a time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlYIdWQc-jw?si=ZQ5809CbQGEar0vg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="2.

Check for frays or discoloration on the accessory; often, these are signs that something is wrong with it.</p><p> If your cable is acting up, you could borrow one from a neighbor or friend and try that with your device instead. If it works, you can be assured that the problem was simply the accessory itself, not your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-ssCD10v2M?si=WVWGNayUiCAkMZzZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Check-the-Adapter"><a href="#4-Check-the-Adapter" class="headerlink" title="4.

Look for signs of damage inside the USB port on your iPhone’s charger.</p><p> You can use an anti-static brush or a new toothbrush to remove dirt, lint, or other debris. Also, try using another adapter because the current one might be faulty.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wiIVztRIqQ?si=GBgdwQ78k5hbeFDv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Clean-Your-Charging-Port"><a href="#5-Clean-Your-Charging-Port" class="headerlink" title="5.

A buildup of dirt inside the Lightning port often prevents accessories from making contact and triggers the error alert you’re getting.</p><p> Get a flashlight and take a close look inside your iPhone’s Lightning port. If you notice any particles or debris inside the Lightning port, gently clean it using the SIM-eject tool and see if that resolves the issue.</p><h2 id="6-Ensure-the-Lightning-Connector-Is-Dry"><a href="#6-Ensure-the-Lightning-Connector-Is-Dry" class="headerlink" title="6. Ensure the Lightning Connector Is Dry"></a>6. Ensure the Lightning Connector Is Dry</h2><p> If your iPhone has been exposed to liquid recently, this may also prompt the “accessory not supported” alert. Therefore, you might want to try <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-drying-smartphone-usb-port/" >drying the charging port on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Some iPhone users take water contact lightly because they assume their devices are waterproof, but they aren’t. iPhones are only water-resistant and could still be damaged if exposed to water.</p><h2 id="7-Get-MFi-Certified-Accessories"><a href="#7-Get-MFi-Certified-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="7.

To prevent this, make sure that the charging cable and accessories you use to charge your iPhone are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-mfi-certified-explained/" >Apple MFi-certified <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , meaning they were made according to Apple’s design standards.</p><p> MFi means Made for iPhone, iPad, or iPad.<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/HT204566" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides in-depth guides to help you identify fake iPhone accessories. But the easy method is that MFi-certified accessories have a discerning badge on the packaging.</p><p> Also, if the accessories are suspiciously cheap, they are probably fake and not Apple-approved. Apart from the minor inconvenience of not charging your iPhone, these cables can also cause severe damage to your iPhone and are part of the reason <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-iphone-lightning-cable-never-lasts/" >why your iPhone cables don’t last <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> As much as possible, stick to charging your iPhone with the cable it came with, or get a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-lightning-cables-charge-iphone-ipad/" >durable third-party cable to charge your iPhone or iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4lRBnNnd9k?si=5e0MbdOz-fF6Ry_k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Make-Sure-Your-Accessory-Is-Compatible"><a href="#8-Make-Sure-Your-Accessory-Is-Compatible" class="headerlink" title="8.

Just because an accessory fits into the port doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the correct type. Some accessories only work with specific iPhone, iPad, or iPod models. If you’re not sure, contact the manufacturer.</p><p> This is another reason to get accessories from certified outlets. They provide helpful details and guidance while choosing the accessory, and after-sale support is more likely to be available to you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5pwd2mwaQQ?si=qyZHgdTlbQbc32Mp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Update-Your-iPhone"><a href="#9-Update-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="9.

This returns all settings to their default state without erasing data.</p><p> Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset &gt; Reset All Settings</strong> . The process may take a while if you have a lot of files stored on your iPhone, so you may want to use the workaround below if you need your iPhone to connect in order to transfer files or charge.</p><h2 id="11-Connect-Your-iPhone-Wirelessly"><a href="#11-Connect-Your-iPhone-Wirelessly" class="headerlink" title="11.

This is important if you need to charge your iPhone or transfer some files urgently.</p><p> Try wireless charging if your iPhone model is compatible. To transfer files, you can upload them to platforms like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/icloud-drive-vs-google-one/" >iCloud or Google Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your iPhone, then access them afterward on your computer.</p><h2 id="If-All-Else-Fails-Take-Your-iPhone-for-Repair"><a href="#If-All-Else-Fails-Take-Your-iPhone-for-Repair" class="headerlink" title="If All Else Fails, Take Your iPhone for Repair"></a>If All Else Fails, Take Your iPhone for Repair</h2><p> If your iPhone still says “this accessory may not be supported” after you’ve tried all the steps above, the suggested workarounds are, understandably, only temporary solutions.</p><p> Therefore, it’s best to contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider for further assistance. If you have an AppleCare plan, you can also contact Apple Support to make an appointment at an Apple Store near you and have a technician examine the iPhone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-pro-gif-designers-picks-online-vs-desktop-platforms/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Pro-Gif Designers' Picks Online vs Desktop Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-explore-the-world-through-ultra-hd-with-leading-mirrorless-cams/"><u>[Updated] Explore the World Through Ultra-HD with Leading Mirrorless Cams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-prime-radio-playscript-artistry/"><u>[Updated] Prime Radio Playscript Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionary-storage-solutions-select-from-the-best-20-free-options-1tbplus/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionary Storage Solutions - Select From the Best 20 Free Options (1TB+)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/image-illumination-incor-writings-on-visual-canvases-online/"><u>Image Illumination Incor Writings on Visual Canvases Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/iphone-and-ipad-keyboards-failing-discover-6-fixes/"><u>IPhone & iPad Keyboards Failing?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="7-Reasons-for-Slow-Wireless-Internet-on-Phones-and-How-to-Fix-Them"><a href="#7-Reasons-for-Slow-Wireless-Internet-on-Phones-and-How-to-Fix-Them" class="headerlink" title="7 Reasons for Slow Wireless Internet on Phones and How to Fix Them"></a>7 Reasons for Slow Wireless Internet on Phones and How to Fix Them</h2><p> Since smartphones are the primary way most people connect to the internet, getting the fastest possible internet speeds on your mobile devices is more important than ever.</p><p> But that doesn’t always happen. There are lots of problems that can slow the Wi-Fi speed on your phone down. Let’s take a look at the main reasons why the internet connection is so slow on your phone, and how you can increase your Wi-Fi speed.</p><h2 id="1-Poor-Router-Position"><a href="#1-Poor-Router-Position" class="headerlink" title="1. Poor Router Position"></a>1. Poor Router Position</h2><p> One of the main reasons your phone’s Wi-Fi is slow is that you’ve got your router positioned in the wrong place.</p><p> Depending on the specs and design of your router, the signal can have a range of up to a few hundred feet. But the further it travels, the slower it gets. The Wi-Fi signal can be blocked by large physical objects, like walls, floors, and doors too.</p><p> So if you’re a long distance from the router—like in the furthest bedroom in your house, or even outside—the speeds you get might be a lot slower than you’d expect.</p><p> There’s a quick way to test this. The Wi-Fi icon on your phone’s status bar gives you a rough indication of the signal strength.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wifi-signal-icons.jpeg"                      alt="wifi signal icons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMuxjTCMX2E?si=ylRTMJuUstpjLsZc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>When the icon is full, you’ve got a strong signal. This suggests your slow internet has a different cause.</li><li>When it’s empty, or nearly empty, your signal is weak. Other Wi-Fi devices like your laptop should also be affected at these long distances. When you move closer to your router, your signal strength—and internet speed—should improve.</li></ul><p> When the weak signal does improve as you get closer, it shows that your router’s position is the problem. Try <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wireless-feng-shui-optimize-house-wifi-reception/" >experimenting with different router positions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see if you can get better Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, or take steps to try and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-boost-wifi-signal/" >extend your router’s range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If your speed doesn’t improve when you get closer to the router, or if the Wi-Fi is slow on your phone but not other devices, you may have other problems you need to fix.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0XhU5H8R4?si=cFPk6XK3X3CQSI7Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Congested-Wi-Fi"><a href="#2-Congested-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="2.

Routers broadcast their signal on a specified channel, but if your neighbors have their routers set to the same channel, it can become congested and degrade the performance for everyone.</p><p> This can be a problem in apartment blocks especially, where you have a lot of routers crammed into a relatively small area.</p><p> To fix this, you need to use software that can help you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-change-wifi-channel/" >find the best channel for your router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Wi-Fi Noise</h2><p> As well as interference from other nearby routers, Wi-Fi is also susceptible to noise from appliances in your home. Devices like microwaves, wireless doorbells, and cordless phones can interfere with the signal from a router running on the 2.4GHz band.</p><p> Most modern routers can work on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. The latter is a lot less prone to interference. If you’ve got a fairly recent router that supports this, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-things-must-brand-new-router/" >delve into the router’s settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to enable 5GHz broadcasting.</p><p> Before you do this, though, you need to make sure all your connected devices—not just your phone—support 5GHz, or they’ll no longer be able to connect. Many modern routers are dual-band, meaning they can broadcast on both bands simultaneously. If you don’t have one of these, you’ll have to choose either one or the other.</p><p> If you’re sticking with 2.4GHz, make sure you don’t have any other devices near your router that could cause interference. And prepare for possible disruption if you’re streaming Netflix while standing in the kitchen making microwave popcorn.</p><h2 id="4-You’re-Connected-to-a-Slow-Network"><a href="#4-You’re-Connected-to-a-Slow-Network" class="headerlink" title="4.

Streaming movies, downloading video games, or installing operating system updates will all cause a slowdown in your general internet use.</p><p> On public Wi-Fi, the speeds you’ll get can vary wildly, and you shouldn’t rely on getting a superfast service from something you aren’t paying for. However, even after checking your expectations, you might still end up getting far worse performance than you could.</p><p> There are so many public Wi-Fi hotspots, and your phone is liable to latch onto one of them at random. It’ll often even stay connected after you’ve moved into the range of a closer or better one. This means that while your favorite coffee shop might have fantastic Wi-Fi, there’s no guarantee you’ll connect to it every time.</p><p> A good way to work around this is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wifi-network-priority-android-iphone/" >set the Wi-Fi network priority <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Android or iPhone. This forces your device to always connect to one of your chosen networks whenever you’re in range, and only use other free hotspots as a last resort.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_SbYznUy_zY?si=ThBkP934r3mizi48" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-You’re-Using-a-Slow-VPN"><a href="#5-You’re-Using-a-Slow-VPN" class="headerlink" title="5.

One reason for this could be that you’ve started using a VPN, which gives you more security and privacy online.</p><p> But did you know that your choice of VPN can have a significant effect on your internet speed?</p><p> Free VPN apps are notorious for offering terrible performance. If you’re using one and getting slow internet speeds, try disabling it temporarily to see if that improves your experience.</p><p> Most of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-free-vpn-services-compared-which-is-fastest/" >fastest VPN providers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have apps for iPhone and Android and offer a free trial period so you can test them out.

When you switch to mobile data, you’d expect your connection to be as fast or even faster than Wi-Fi. But this isn’t always true.</p><p> There are so many things that can affect your phone signal. You’ll see this manifest often in crowded places, like at a sporting event or concert. When tens of thousands of people are trying to connect to the same cell tower at the same time, performance suffers.</p><p> And there are other potential factors, too. Your distance from the nearest tower, whether you’re indoors or outdoors, and even the weather can have an effect.</p><p> So you might have a 5G phone, but 5G coverage could be patchy enough that you might not benefit from it. And some of these issues can even cause a 4G phone to fall back to a slower 3G connection; others might leave you with no internet connection at all.</p><p> In addition, smaller mobile carriers might have more limited bandwidth, meaning you may never get up to top speed on those. Speak to your carrier if you have ongoing problems. If there’s no solution, it may be time to change to a better provider.</p><h2 id="7-Your-Phone-Is-Slow"><a href="#7-Your-Phone-Is-Slow" class="headerlink" title="7. Your Phone Is Slow"></a>7. Your Phone Is Slow</h2><p> Finally, slow phone internet might just be a sign of a slow phone. Your Wi-Fi connection may be great, your mobile data coverage perfect, and you’re on a fast network. But maybe your phone just can’t keep up with what you’re asking it to do.</p><p> The resource requirements of apps and websites creep up all the time. So even when your actual internet speed is good, you might still perceive it to be slow. The phone’s hardware might be taking its time rendering a webpage, for example, or struggling to handle the graphics in an online game.</p><p> You can see this on older phones and lower-end Android phones especially. But even if you’ve got an up-to-date, high-end device, your choice of apps can still have an impact. Too many apps downloading and syncing in the background can hog too much of your available bandwidth.</p><p> Older or poorly written apps can make your phone slow generally. Make sure to keep your apps up to date,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/find-and-delete-unused-apps-android/" >uninstall apps that you don’t use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and keep an eye on which are allowed to run in the background. And in extreme cases, it might even be time to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/upgrading-smartphone-questions/" >consider whether it’s worth buying a new smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Why-Is-My-Phone’s-Internet-So-Slow-Now-You-Understand"><a href="#Why-Is-My-Phone’s-Internet-So-Slow-Now-You-Understand" class="headerlink" title="Why Is My Phone’s Internet So Slow?

Fortunately, most of them are easy to fix. They’re often caused by issues with your hardware, so you may need to make tweaks on your router to resolve the problem for your other devices too.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-hours-of-videography-expected-gb-usage-for-2024/"><u>[New] Hours of Videography Expected GB Usage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-compliant-twitter-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Complete Guide to Compliant Twitter Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-special.techidaily.com/brancher-la-touche-pour-retrouver-vos-donnees-perdues-suite-a-la-reconfiguration-de-votre-systeme-dexploitation-windows-1011-methodes-efficaces/"><u>Brancher La Touche Pour Retrouver Vos Données Perdues Suite À La Reconfiguration De Votre Système D'exploitation Windows 10/11 - Méthodes Efficaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ensuring-confidentiality-with-business-focused-chatgpt/"><u>Ensuring Confidentiality with Business-Focused ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/entropy-changes-can-be-calculated-using-the-formula-ds-qrevt-for-reversible-processes-where-qrev-is-the-heat-exchanged-and-t-is-the-absolute-temperature/"><u>Entropy Changes Can Be Calculated Using the Formula ΔS = Q_rev/T for Reversible Processes, Where Q_rev Is the Heat Exchanged and T Is the Absolute Temperature.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/get-the-latest-amd-vega-graphics-card-drivers-quick-and-effortless-updates-for-gamers/"><u>Get the Latest AMD Vega Graphics Card Drivers: Quick & Effortless Updates for Gamers!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-the-hey-siri-issue-in-just-17-steps-on-your-iphone-device/"><u>How to Resolve the Hey Siri Issue in Just 17 Steps on Your iPhone Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/iphones-silent-treatment-how-to-restore-functionality-with-these-7-volume-troubleshooting-steps/"><u>IPhone's Silent Treatment: How to Restore Functionality with These 7 Volume Troubleshooting Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/oppo-find-n3-flip-not-receiving-texts-10-hassle-free-solutions-here-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Oppo Find N3 Flip Not Receiving Texts? 10 Hassle-Free Solutions Here | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/overcome-your-iphones-lagging-issues-with-these-6-essential-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Overcome Your iPhone's Lagging Issues with These 6 Essential Tips and Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/prevent-your-airpods-from-connecting-to-multiple-iphones-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Prevent Your AirPods From Connecting to Multiple iPhones: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/step-by-step-fixes-for-inaccurate-web-browsing-records-in-your-ios-devices-screen-time/"><u>Step-by-Step Fixes for Inaccurate Web Browsing Records in Your iOS Device's Screen Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/top-10-airplay-apps-in-samsung-galaxy-a05s-for-streaming-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Samsung Galaxy A05s for Streaming | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/trouble-installing-apps-on-your-iphone-discover-10-effective-solutions/"><u>Trouble Installing Apps on Your iPhone?

It turns out this isn’t a bug, it’s a feature: Dynamic Head Tracking. And you can turn it off in the Control Center.</p><p> Below, we’ll explain what Dynamic Head Tracking is and how to customize it for each app on your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LW6wNx3XAj8?si=VaIuFIIx8MM_RhUR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-Dynamic-Head-Tracking"><a href="#What-Is-Dynamic-Head-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="What Is Dynamic Head Tracking?"></a>What Is Dynamic Head Tracking?</h2><p> Apple introduced Dynamic Head Tracking alongside <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-spatial-audio/" >Spatial Audio on the iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create a more immersive audio experience. Essentially, it uses sensors in your AirPods to track your head movement, then adjusts the audio so it always sounds like it’s coming from the direction of your iPhone.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/spatial-audio-vs-spatialize-stereo/" >Spatial Audio vs. Spatialize Stereo: Is There a Difference? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Dynamic Head Tracking is also available when you’re using your AirPods with an iPad, Mac, or Apple TV 4K.</p><p> This is great when you’re watching a movie: whenever you turn your head, the audio still sounds as though it’s coming from your screen, rather than moving with your head. But it’s not so great if you’re listening to a podcast with your phone in your pocket, when you always want the audio to be centered regardless of which direction you turn your head.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFDHJnZLwTA?si=WThcb2h76AnZDzcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-I-Turn-Off-Dynamic-Head-Tracking"><a href="#How-Do-I-Turn-Off-Dynamic-Head-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Turn Off Dynamic Head Tracking?"></a>How Do I Turn Off Dynamic Head Tracking?</h2><p> To disable Dynamic Head Tracking completely, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; AirPods</strong> and disable the<strong>Follow iPhone</strong> option.</p><p> This is quick, but it’s overkill if you still want to benefit from head tracking while watching videos or using certain apps.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Receive-Messages-Phone-Calls-While-Using-iOS-DND-Top-8-Solutions"><a href="#How-to-Receive-Messages-Phone-Calls-While-Using-iOS-DND-Top-8-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="How to Receive Messages &amp; Phone Calls While Using iOS DND: Top 8 Solutions"></a>How to Receive Messages &amp; Phone Calls While Using iOS DND: Top 8 Solutions</h2><p> Whether you want to focus on your task at hand or take a much-needed rest without disruptions, Do Not Disturb is a feature that helps you do just that. No story reply, group chat gossip, or work call will reach you as long as you have Do Not Disturb mode enabled on your iPhone.</p><p> However, if you’re still getting texts and calls on Do Not Disturb, it pretty much defeats the purpose of the feature. So, let’s look at the steps you can take when Do Not Disturb is not working on your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvAC8jgs62o?si=xqEXZ7dpAXZ4sZ7A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode"><a href="#1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Whether You Enabled the Correct Focus Mode"></a>1. Check Whether You Enabled the Correct Focus Mode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-2.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb and personal mode in iphone control center"                ></p><p> Although Apple started with Do Not Disturb, the feature has since been expanded to Focus mode. Focus includes Do Not Disturb, Personal, Work, and so on. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/focus-mode-ideas-to-set-up-in-ios/" >set up different Focus modes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and customize them for different purposes.</p><p> If you accidentally enabled<strong>Work</strong> mode instead of<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> or<strong>Personal</strong> mode on your iPhone, you will certainly receive texts and calls from work colleagues because the latter wasn’t made to deter people from your workplace.</p><p> Therefore, before proceeding with the other suggestions in the list, access your iPhone’s<strong>Control Center</strong> and check that you have the correct Focus mode turned on to match your activity.</p><h2 id="2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps"><a href="#2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2. Review Your Allowed Apps"></a>2. Review Your Allowed Apps</h2><p> Do Not Disturb lets you choose which app you want to receive notifications from, even when it’s enabled. For example, when working, you naturally wouldn’t want to miss notifications from collaborative apps like Slack and Asana.</p><p> But if you feel that Do Not Disturb is not working as it should, and you’re left wondering why you’re still getting notifications from apps you don’t want to hear from, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Apps</strong> to review the apps with allowed notifications.</p><p> Then, tap the<strong>minus (-)</strong> button to remove an unwanted app from the list. This way, it won’t bypass your Do Not Disturb mode anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/focus-modes.JPEG"                      alt="focus modes on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oeSN3u4fO9M?si=Ua3Hzcil6u6akDgY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-apps.JPEG"                      alt="allowed apps on do not disturb mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OxkndZbIA4?si=TWJlkTbYKsVag8-q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfCSLAhd4FY?si=CUBztmilaeAwl1lw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications"><a href="#3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable Time-Sensitive Notifications"></a>3. Disable Time-Sensitive Notifications</h2><p> Examples of time-sensitive notifications are reminders, emails, or messages that contain references to date and time. So, for instance, even if the<strong>Messages</strong> app is not in your list of Allowed Apps, an iPhone text message may still pass through Do Not Disturb due to the nature of its content, thus making it seem that Do Not Disturb is not working on your iPhone.</p><p> If you don’t want to receive such notifications, go to your<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> settings in the<strong>Settings</strong> app. Tap<strong>Apps</strong> and toggle off<strong>Time-Sensitive Notifications</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3-3.jpg"                      alt="disable time sensitive notifications for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p> Alternatively, you can tap<strong>Turn Off</strong> for a specific app if you see its notifications pop up on your Lock Screen.</p><h2 id="4-Change-Settings-for-Incoming-Calls"><a href="#4-Change-Settings-for-Incoming-Calls" class="headerlink" title="4. Change Settings for Incoming Calls"></a>4. Change Settings for Incoming Calls</h2><p> When you first enable Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone,<strong>Favorites</strong> tends to be the default setting for the incoming calls allowed. If you previously added quite a few family members and friends to your Favorites list, this may be why your iPhone calls are coming through even after you enabled Do Not Disturb, as if it’s not working.</p><p> To change this, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt; People</strong> . Now, tap on<strong>Allow Calls From</strong> and select your preferred option. If you want to only allow specific individuals to call you during Do Not Disturb mode, choose<strong>Allowed People Only</strong> and tap the<strong>Add</strong> button above to select your contacts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GU08CQVsZz0?si=V-SvPfzRsQysMS0e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-favorite-calls.JPEG"                      alt="call settings for do not disturb mode on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-calls.JPEG"                      alt="change calls allowed on iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls"><a href="#5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Allow Repeated Calls"></a>5. Don’t Allow Repeated Calls</h2><p> If someone calls you more than once in a three-minute timespan, Do Not Disturb lets their call come through, regardless of the incoming call preferences you indicated earlier. This feature ensures that people can reach you in cases of emergencies, and it’s not because Do Not Disturb is not working.</p><p> But if there are people who call you mindlessly the moment you don’t pick up, and this feature ends up giving you more problems than convenience, you can choose to disable it. As outlined in the previous solution, go to the<strong>People</strong> settings in<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> . Then, toggle off<strong>Allow Repeated Calls</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2-2.jpg"                      alt="turn off allow repeated calls for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KF793jv1LIc?si=fJOogQJ2f8JUfTzZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Turn-Off-or-Hide-Your-Focus-Status"><a href="#6-Turn-Off-or-Hide-Your-Focus-Status" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn Off or Hide Your Focus Status"></a>6. Turn Off or Hide Your Focus Status</h2><p> When you turn on Do Not Disturb, you can also share your Focus status to let your contacts know that you’re temporarily unavailable.</p><p> While it’s a thoughtful feature that helps you inform others, a downside is its accompanying Notify Anyway option, which lets people override your Do Not Disturb mode. This causes text messages and calls to come through your iPhone.</p><p> To stop receiving texts and calls in this manner, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-notify-anyway-focus-mode-iphone/" >turn off your Focus status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-hide-focus-status-from-certain-contacts-iphone/" >hide your Focus status from certain iPhone contacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Review-Your-Do-Not-Disturb-Schedule"><a href="#7-Review-Your-Do-Not-Disturb-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="7. Review Your Do Not Disturb Schedule"></a>7. Review Your Do Not Disturb Schedule</h2><p> Let’s say you used to work morning shifts every day and had set your Do Not Disturb schedule to match. If you suddenly switch to afternoon shifts, you may feel that Do Not Disturb is not working because you’re receiving unwanted texts and calls on your iPhone during your new working hours.</p><p> However, it’s simply because of your old Do Not Disturb schedule, which automatically turns off in the evening, as per your original setting. So, if there’s a change in your routine, remember to check and adjust your Do Not Disturb schedule to fit accordingly.</p><p> Head to your<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> settings and tap on your existing schedule to edit it. You can also tap<strong>Add Schedule</strong> to set a new time to turn on Do Not Disturb.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-schedule.JPEG"                      alt="schedule for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-schedule-2.JPEG"                      alt="automate schedule for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-change-schedule.JPEG"                      alt="set time for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxFUhesNCKo?si=Ti0ui6DXYP12sjSs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Restart-Your-iPhone-and-Update-iOS"><a href="#8-Restart-Your-iPhone-and-Update-iOS" class="headerlink" title="8.

You’re prompted to update your payment method to continue enjoying the service, but you weren’t aware your card needed updating.</p><p> Or perhaps you want to add a payment method to your Apple ID, but it gets declined. What do you do in either situation? Below, we’ll list a few steps you can take when Apple declines your payment method.</p><h2 id="1-Check-Your-Payment-Information"><a href="#1-Check-Your-Payment-Information" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Your Payment Information"></a>1.

If your billing details, such as your address or ZIP code, is incorrect, this can cause your payment method to be declined.</p><p> If your current payment method has expired, you must renew your credit card and update your payment information or add a new payment method.</p><p>To check your payment information on an iPhone or iPad:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings</strong> , then tap your<strong>Apple ID name</strong> at the top.</li><li>Tap on<strong>Payment &amp; Shipping</strong> , then under<strong>Payment Methods</strong> , select your credit card.</li><li>Check your card number, expiry date, CVV, and billing information.

It doesn’t fix your Home button, but it does let you keep using your iPhone without a working Home button.</p><p> Here’s how to add a Home button to your iPhone screen with AssistiveTouch:</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Touch &gt; AssistiveTouch</strong> . On older versions of iOS, you need to go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; AssistiveTouch</strong> instead. If you can’t exit your current app to access Settings,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restart your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to go to the Home screen.</li><li>Turn on the toggle for<strong>AssistiveTouch</strong> . You should see a semi-transparent button appear on your screen. Tap it to reveal a popup menu, then tap<strong>Home</strong> to simulate pressing the Home button.</li><li>Drag and drop the AssistiveTouch button to move it around your iPhone screen so it doesn’t get in the way. You can also use Siri to turn it off and on when you don’t need it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iPhone-General-Settings.jpg"                      alt="iPhone General Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iPhone-Accessibility-Settings.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Accessibility Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iPhone-Touch-Settings.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Touch Settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> It’s worth taking a moment to customize the AssistiveTouch options from the Settings to make it as useful as possible. If you only use it as a Home button, you can even make that the only option, so you don’t need to open a popup menu anymore.</p><h2 id="2-“Recalibrate”-the-Home-Button"><a href="#2-“Recalibrate”-the-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="2. “Recalibrate” the Home Button"></a>2. “Recalibrate” the Home Button</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Slide-to-power-off-prompt-on-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Slide to power off prompt on iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-mXUpVQijU?si=f1MzflPJ8-bD2_iQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> We’ve used “recalibrate” in quotes here because this is not an official term. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be a definitive source for this trick, but it’s proven to be effective at fixing iPhone Home buttons regardless of why they aren’t working.</p><p> Again, you can use this trick to fix the Home button on any applicable device. The worst that could happen is that your Home button still doesn’t work after you try it.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><ol><li>Launch any app that came pre-installed on your device. For example, you might open<strong>Notes</strong> ,<strong>Calendar</strong> ,<strong>Reminders</strong> , or<strong>Photos</strong> .</li><li>Now press and hold the<strong>Top</strong> or<strong>Side</strong> button on your iPhone until the<strong>Slide to power off</strong> prompt appears. If nothing appears, try holding either<strong>Volume</strong> button at the same time.</li><li>Don’t power off your iPhone. Instead, press and hold the<strong>Home</strong> button for around 10 seconds until the prompt disappears and the app quits.</li></ol><p> That’s it. This fix should work for physical Home buttons that aren’t working on the iPhone 6S and earlier, as well as the touch-based Home buttons on the iPhone 7 up to the iPhone SE.</p><p> If this didn’t fix your Home button, try repeating the process several times. Some users have reported that their Home button started working after three or four attempts.</p><h2 id="3-Restore-the-Firmware-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#3-Restore-the-Firmware-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore the Firmware on Your iPhone"></a>3. Restore the Firmware on Your iPhone</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iPhone-restore-window-from-Finder.jpg"                      alt="iPhone restore window from Finder"                ></p><p> This one isn’t a quick method, but it still might be the quickest way to get your iPhone Home button working. A lot of the time when the Home button isn’t working, it comes down to a fault in the software or firmware on your iPhone. You can fix these issues for free by restoring the device using DFU mode.</p><p> When you do this, it erases all the data from your iPhone. So you should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-iphone-ipad/" >make sure you’ve got a recent iPhone backup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first.</p><p> You also need to set aside at least an hour. Restoring your device with DFU mode rewrites every bit of the software and firmware. Sometimes, this takes a while.</p><p> Follow the instructions in our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-dfu-mode-iphone-and-how-to-use-it/" >restoring your iPhone using DFU mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If that doesn’t work, you know your Home button definitely has a hardware problem. One of the other tips below can still help you fix it, though.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jng92DT1n_Y?si=LvxQhsEJoymsM2iZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Clean-the-Home-Button-Using-Isopropyl-Alcohol"><a href="#4-Clean-the-Home-Button-Using-Isopropyl-Alcohol" class="headerlink" title="4.

That filth might clog the mechanism, which could explain why the Home button stopped working. Unfortunately, this tip can’t help if the Home button isn’t working on an iPhone 7, an iPhone SE, or later because those devices don’t feature a mechanical button.</p><p>Here’s the proper way to clean the Home button on your iPhone:</p><ol><li>Start off by wiping the Home button using a clean, dry microfiber cloth.</li><li>If that doesn’t work, lightly dampen the cloth with 98 to 99 percent isopropyl alcohol. This evaporates in the air, so it shouldn’t cause damage to your iPhone components.</li><li>Rub the alcohol over the Home button while repeatedly clicking it. As you click the Home button, the alcohol should work its way inside to loosen any dirt.</li></ol><h2 id="5-Use-Your-Charger-to-Press-Against-the-Home-Button"><a href="#5-Use-Your-Charger-to-Press-Against-the-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="5.

Some people have fixed their Home button by applying a small amount of pressure in this area, presumably because doing so reconnected the cable.</p><p> Of course, you need to be incredibly careful when trying this. You don’t want to break anything inside your iPhone. You also need to be careful you don’t snap off the Lightning or 30-pin connector inside the charging port, which can be almost impossible to remove.</p><p>Follow these simple steps to try it:</p><ol><li>Insert the charging cable that came with your iPhone.</li><li>Gently press on the back of the connector, near the bottom of your iPhone, as though you’re pushing it towards the Home button.</li><li>Keep that pressure while you click the Home button a couple of times.</li></ol><p> You will hopefully find that this fixes the Home button on your iPhone for a few weeks or more. However, you’ll probably need to get the Home button on your iPhone replaced eventually. With an iPhone 7 or later, you can’t replace the Home button, so you may need a replacement device instead.</p><h2 id="Find-Out-How-to-Replace-the-Home-Button-Yourself"><a href="#Find-Out-How-to-Replace-the-Home-Button-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Find Out How to Replace the Home Button Yourself"></a>Find Out How to Replace the Home Button Yourself</h2><p> If your iPhone is less than a year old, it might still be covered by Apple’s one-year warranty. That means you can make an appointment at the Genius Bar in your nearest Apple Store to have Apple repair your Home button for free.</p><p> Unfortunately, most iPhones with a physical Home button are more than a year old. But you can still pay for a repair from Apple or a third-party service provider.</p><p> That said, it’s usually cheaper to repair it yourself. There are lots of sites that show you how to repair your gadgets, including how to fix a Home button that isn’t working. Some of them even sell all the parts and tools you need for a particular repair.

But sometimes, iPhone alarms don’t go off. This can be a big problem that can lead to getting in trouble at work or school.</p><p> If your iPhone alarm didn’t go off, you should look into that immediately. After all, if it didn’t go off once, it might not go off next time either.</p><p> If this happened to you, don’t worry. It’s a somewhat common problem reported by iPhone users, so there are plenty of solutions, which we’ve listed below.</p><h2 id="1-iPhone-Alarm-Not-Going-Off-Try-This-First"><a href="#1-iPhone-Alarm-Not-Going-Off-Try-This-First" class="headerlink" title="1. iPhone Alarm Not Going Off? Try This First"></a>1. iPhone Alarm Not Going Off? Try This First</h2><p> Sometimes, you may set an alarm as a one-time alarm by mistake, rather than setting a repeating alarm. This also means that if you forget to set it one night, it won’t go off the next morning.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-change-snooze-time-on-iphone/" >How to Change the Snooze Time on iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To check this, head to the<strong>Clock</strong> app and tap<strong>Alarm</strong> from the bottom bar. Then tap on your desired alarm to check the settings and check the<strong>Repeat</strong> settings. You can schedule this alarm to repeat every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/alarm-repeat.jpg"                      alt="alarm repeat"                ></p><p> If you already have a repeating alarm and it didn’t go off, proceed to the next step.</p><h2 id="2-Delete-and-Recreate-Your-iPhone-Alarms"><a href="#2-Delete-and-Recreate-Your-iPhone-Alarms" class="headerlink" title="2. Delete and Recreate Your iPhone Alarms"></a>2. Delete and Recreate Your iPhone Alarms</h2><p> Some iPhone users have reported that deleting all their alarms and making them again resolved the issue. We’re not sure why this might help, but it does seem to be a legitimate way to fix your iPhone alarms.</p><p> To delete all of your alarms, head to the<strong>Clock</strong> app, open the<strong>Alarms</strong> tab. Make a note of any alarms you want to recreate. Then tap<strong>Edit</strong> in the top left-hand corner and delete all the alarms by tapping the red icon next to each alarm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/alarm-delete.jpg"                      alt="alarm delete"                ></p><p> Once this is done, you can create a new alarm using the button in the top right-hand corner. Be sure to set it to repeat if you plan to use this alarm every morning.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-BHGGIC0zE?si=FzUQKZa-bx8OlKuB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Update-Your-iOS-Version"><a href="#3-Update-Your-iOS-Version" class="headerlink" title="3.

Because of this, updating iOS on your iPhone has the potential to resolve many issues, including issues with your alarm not going off.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >How to Update Your iPhone: iOS, Apps, and Data Backups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> This is especially true if your iPhone’s Clock app has the Bedtime setting. The Bedtime setting was a short-lived feature in iOS that set your sleep schedule and alarms. However, it was buggy and caused alarms not to go off. Apple later moved this functionality to the Health app under the Sleep settings.</p><p> If you still have this Bedtime feature, updating the iOS is a quick and easy way to get rid of it. If not, updating could still resolve the issue.</p><h2 id="4-Turn-Off-Your-Sleep-Settings"><a href="#4-Turn-Off-Your-Sleep-Settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Turn Off Your Sleep Settings"></a>4. Turn Off Your Sleep Settings</h2><p> Sleep is the successor to the Bedtime setting. While less buggy than Bedtime, Sleep can still cause your alarm not to go off, especially if it interferes with another active alarm.</p><p> To avoid problems with this in the future, it might be best to turn it off. That way, if you change your alarm to the Sleep time, it will still go off.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-bring-back-keypad-entry-in-alarm-clock-iphone/" >How to Bring Back the Keypad Entry in the Alarm Clock in iOS 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To turn the Sleep features off, open the<strong>Health</strong> app, go to<strong>Browse</strong> and tap<strong>Sleep</strong> . Then tap<strong>Full Schedule &amp; Options</strong> . This will open up the Sleep settings in the Health app. Then tap<strong>Sleep Schedule</strong> at the top to turn your sleep schedule off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sleep-schedule.PNG"                      alt="sleep schedule"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/May-pLCUkEA?si=PGlcFZAlsp3S3beI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Disable-Bluetooth-Settings-and-Unplug-All-Accessories"><a href="#5-Disable-Bluetooth-Settings-and-Unplug-All-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="5.

Disable Bluetooth Settings and Unplug All Accessories</h2><p> If you use Bluetooth headphones, or another Bluetooth device, they could be preventing you from hearing your alarm.</p><p> Bluetooth headphones, if connected, will play the alarm through the headphones and not through your phone speakers. This means that if you’re not wearing your headphones, you won’t hear the alarm.</p><p> Other Bluetooth speakers, and even your car, can prevent you from hearing your alarm as well. This can also be an issue if you live with people who might turn on a Bluetooth speaker that your iPhone automatically connects to.</p><p> To prevent this from being an issue, you can put your iPhone in Airplane Mode before going to bed.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-airplane-mode/" >What Is Airplane Mode?

In some cases, this could fix your issue. However, there are cases where nothing will change.</p><p> The last resort would be to erase all of your content and settings to factory default. This will work in almost every case if all else fails.
