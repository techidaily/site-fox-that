But it’s far from perfect, so you may occasionally face issues initiating or finishing an AirDrop transfer. Below, we list some troubleshooting steps to help you fix these problems.</p><h2 id="1-Change-Your-AirDrop-Visibility-Settings"><a href="#1-Change-Your-AirDrop-Visibility-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Change Your AirDrop Visibility Settings"></a>1. Change Your AirDrop Visibility Settings</h2><p> AirDrop gives you three visibility options:<strong>Everyone</strong> ,<strong>Contacts Only</strong> , or<strong>Receiving Off</strong> . If your device isn’t showing up on AirDrop, it might be on<strong>Receiving Off</strong> . Therefore, switch to<strong>Everyone</strong> or<strong>Contacts Only</strong> , depending on the recipient.</p><p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-customize-control-center-iphone/">Open<strong>Control Center</strong> on your iPhone or iPad</a> , then tap and hold in the top-left section to reveal an<strong>AirDrop</strong> button.

Prepare Both Devices to Receive an AirDrop Request"></a>2. Prepare Both Devices to Receive an AirDrop Request</h2><p> Your device can’t be discovered if it’s locked and in sleep mode. You must prepare your device for incoming AirDrop transfers, making it more likely to show up on someone else’s device without delay.</p><p> Unlock your iPhone or iPad and leave it on the Home Screen to prepare it. On a Mac, open a new<strong>Finder</strong> window and select<strong>Go &gt; AirDrop</strong> from the menu bar to prepare for an AirDrop request.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/go-tab-in-mac-finder.jpg"                      alt="go tab in mac finder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RCYs8keh-Vs?si=uDC28-9yh-k6HLj4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Turn-Off-AirDrop-Restrictions"><a href="#3-Turn-Off-AirDrop-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn Off AirDrop Restrictions"></a>3. Turn Off AirDrop Restrictions</h2><p> If AirDrop isn’t showing up at all, you may have blocked it in your<strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong> for Screen Time. On an iPhone or iPad, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions &gt; Allowed Apps</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iphone-limit-usage-settings.JPEG"                      alt="iphone limit usage settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iphone-content-and-privacy-restrictions-settings.JPEG"                      alt="iphone content and privacy restrictions settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/allowed-apps-in-iphone-content-and-privacy-restriction-settings.JPEG"                      alt="allowed apps in iphone content and privacy restriction settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXIq2G0nShk?si=5Z4Fwv7ZB6oKWsdd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> On a Mac, go to <strong>System Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy &gt; App Restrictions</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/content-and-privacy-settings-on-mac.jpg"                      alt="content and privacy settings on mac"                ></p><p> Make sure<strong>AirDrop</strong> is turned on for each device.

Enable AirDrop Over Cellular"></a>4. Enable AirDrop Over Cellular</h2><p> AirDrop’s (Bluetooth) range is around 30 feet, so if you move beyond that distance, AirDrop won’t work anymore. But if you’ve updated your device to iOS&#x2F;iPadOS 17.1 (or later), you can enable a setting to allow AirDrop file transfers to continue even after you leave the range.</p><p> On your iPhone or iPad, go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; AirDrop</strong> and toggle on<strong>Use Cellular Data</strong> to ensure transfers occur over LTE or 5G.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iphone-general-settings-2.JPEG"                      alt="iphone general settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-general-settings.JPEG"                      alt="iPhone General settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YCkNXJjC3c?si=9Tn8KiqKGTZi1o7E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iphone-airdrop-settings.JPEG"                      alt="iphone airdrop settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-Allow-Sharing-by-Bringing-Devices-Together"><a href="#5-Allow-Sharing-by-Bringing-Devices-Together" class="headerlink" title="5. Allow Sharing by Bringing Devices Together"></a>5. Allow Sharing by Bringing Devices Together</h2><p> This particular fix is specific to NameDrop, a feature Apple introduced alongside iOS 17. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-contacts-namedrop-iphone/" >use NameDrop to share contact information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by placing the top edge of two iPhones close to each other.</p><p> If NameDrop isn’t working, check if your device has the right settings. On your iPhone, go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; AirDrop</strong> and toggle on<strong>Bringing Devices Together</strong> if you haven’t.</p><p> Note that NameDrop only lets you share new contact information. You can’t update an existing contact with NameDrop.</p><h2 id="6-Turn-Off-Do-Not-Disturb-Mode"><a href="#6-Turn-Off-Do-Not-Disturb-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn Off Do Not Disturb Mode"></a>6. Turn Off Do Not Disturb Mode</h2><p> Your device may not receive transfer requests from AirDrop if Do Not Disturb or another Focus mode is enabled. Open<strong>Control Center</strong> and hit the<strong>Focus</strong> icon (the default is a<strong>moon</strong> icon) to turn it off on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Control-Center-on-Mac.jpg"                      alt="Control Center on Mac"                ></p><h2 id="7-Restart-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-on-Both-Devices"><a href="#7-Restart-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-on-Both-Devices" class="headerlink" title="7. Restart Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on Both Devices"></a>7. Restart Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on Both Devices</h2><p> A particularly useful solution if AirDrop isn’t working is to disable and re-enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Open<strong>Control Center</strong> on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and hit the<strong>Wi-Fi</strong> and<strong>Bluetooth</strong> icons to turn them off, then select them again to turn them back on.</p><h2 id="8-Use-AirDrop-From-a-Third-Apple-Device"><a href="#8-Use-AirDrop-From-a-Third-Apple-Device" class="headerlink" title="8. Use AirDrop From a Third Apple Device"></a>8. Use AirDrop From a Third Apple Device</h2><p> This isn’t an option for everyone, but if you have a spare Apple device, you should try using that to connect over AirDrop. Usually, if your iPhone, iPad, or Mac shows up on this new device, it will suddenly appear on the original device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un9G2_OdSRI?si=vAcGbco8DuWt4ypP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Send-a-Single-File-Instead-of-Multiple-Files"><a href="#9-Send-a-Single-File-Instead-of-Multiple-Files" class="headerlink" title="9. Send a Single File Instead of Multiple Files"></a>9. Send a Single File Instead of Multiple Files</h2><p> AirDrop lets you share many kinds of files at the same time. But if AirDrop isn’t working, you should consider simplifying matters by sending a single file at a time instead.</p><p> AirDrop files automatically open in a relevant app. For instance, images open in the Photos app, but multiple file types don’t always open in the same app. This could explain why your AirDrop transfer failed.</p><h2 id="10-Check-the-Downloads-Folder-for-Missing-Files"><a href="#10-Check-the-Downloads-Folder-for-Missing-Files" class="headerlink" title="10. Check the Downloads Folder for Missing Files"></a>10. Check the Downloads Folder for Missing Files</h2><p> If AirDrop sent a file to your device but you can’t find it, take a look in the Downloads folder. On an iPhone, open the<strong>Files</strong> app and select the<strong>Browse</strong> tab from the bottom. Then, head into<strong>iCloud Drive</strong> or<strong>On My iPhone</strong> and tap into the<strong>Downloads</strong> folder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/browse-tab-in-iphone-files-app.JPEG"                      alt="browse tab in iphone files app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/on-my-iphone-folder-in-files-app.JPEG"                      alt="on my iphone folder in files app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxUX4R6Cf7c?si=prHevNQJivSkIfUt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> On a Mac, you can usually find the<strong>Downloads</strong> folder by opening a new Finder window and pressing<strong>Option + Command + L</strong> .

Turn Off Your VPN for AirDrop to Work</h2><p> Some users found that AirDrop didn’t work until they <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-vpn-on-iphone/" >turned off the VPN on their iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Mac. You might need to do this in the VPN app or your device settings.</p><p> On an iPhone or iPad, go to<strong>Settings &gt; VPN</strong> to do this. On a Mac, go to<strong>System Settings &gt; Network &gt; VPN</strong> .</p><h2 id="12-Open-Your-Mac’s-Firewall-to-More-Connections"><a href="#12-Open-Your-Mac’s-Firewall-to-More-Connections" class="headerlink" title="12. Open Your Mac’s Firewall to More Connections"></a>12. Open Your Mac’s Firewall to More Connections</h2><p> The firewall on your Mac might be set to block all incoming connections, which often includes new AirDrop transfers. You’ll need to loosen these restrictions from System Settings if AirDrop still isn’t working.</p><p> Go to<strong>System Settings &gt; Network &gt; Firewall</strong> .

When you reset these settings, your device forgets any Wi-Fi passwords you’ve saved, so you’ll have to manually reconnect to trusted networks again.</p><p> If you still want to go ahead with it, go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset [Device] &gt; Reset</strong> and tap<strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> .

Over time and use, you’ll come across a few bugs and issues.</p><p> Luckily, there are some steps you can take to solve many of the more prevalent iPhone 13 problems.

That’s because lithium-ion batteries degrade over time due to several reasons. Depending on how you use your iPhone, it may degrade faster or slower.</p><p> It’s hard to pinpoint the cause, and if it’s the physical battery, then you have to replace the phone or send it in to replace the battery.</p><p> However, if it’s a software issue, there’s a chance you can fix it.

Activation Error on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro"></a>4. Activation Error on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</h2><p> One of the more frustrating iPhone 13 bugs involves activation problems. If you can’t activate your iPhone 13, you won’t be able to log in to use the phone at all.</p><p> This can happen in two ways. You’ll either get an activation error, a message stating that the phone can’t detect your SIM card, or that it’s invalid.</p><p> Fortunately, you can follow a few steps to solve the iPhone 13 activation bug. However, they’re pretty limited. Here’s one method you can try:</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >Restart your iPhone 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Connect to a Wi-Fi network.</li><li>Try activating your iPhone 13 again.</li></ol><p> You can try an alternate method if these steps don’t solve the activation issue. For these steps, you’ll need the latest version of macOS or iTunes. Here are the steps you can try:</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201352" >Update iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your Windows PC. If you use a Mac, update macOS to the latest version.</li><li>Ensure your computer has an internet connection.</li><li>Use your iPhone 13’s charging cable to connect it to your computer.</li><li>Your computer should automatically detect your iPhone 13.</li></ol><p> If<strong>Set Up as New</strong> or<strong>Restore from Backup</strong> notifications show up on your computer, your iPhone 13 is activated. If<strong>SIM card invalid</strong> or<strong>No SIM Detected</strong> notifications appear, you’ll need to reach out to your phone carrier.</p><p> But if you see the<strong>activation information was invalid</strong> message, you’ll have to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restart-iphone-recovery-mode/" >enter recovery mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to restore your iPhone 13.</p><p> You’ll likely have to reach out to Apple or your phone carrier at some point during the activation process if you’re still running into errors after following these steps.</p><h2 id="5-iPhone-13-Face-ID-Issues"><a href="#5-iPhone-13-Face-ID-Issues" class="headerlink" title="5. iPhone 13 Face ID Issues"></a>5. iPhone 13 Face ID Issues</h2><p> Face ID on iPhone 13 can stop working randomly, potentially barring you from using certain apps and built-in features. Fortunately, you can try a few methods to fix Face ID.</p><p> First, consider cleaning the front-facing camera. It’s surprising how often Face ID won’t work just because there’s a smudge or two on the camera lens.</p><p> You can also check the Face ID settings. To do this, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong> . Then, ensure all the items listed in this menu are toggled on. This includes:</p><ul><li>iPhone Unlock</li><li>iTunes &amp; App Store</li><li>Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</li><li>Password AutoFill</li></ul><p> You can also toggle on Face ID for specific apps from the Settings menu. Simply scroll down, find the app you want to use Face ID for, and use the toggle to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Face-ID-And-Passcode-Highlighted.jpg"                      alt="Face ID And Passcode Highlighted"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Enter-Your-Passcode.jpg"                      alt="Enter Your Passcode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FaceID-And-Passcode-Settings.jpg"                      alt="FaceID And Passcode Settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Another option is to remove and reset Face ID. To do this, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode.</strong> Then, tap<strong>Reset Face ID</strong> .</p><p> Finally, you can add an alternative appearance. First, open<strong>Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong> . Then, tap<strong>Set Up an Alternative Appearance</strong> .</p><p> If these tips aren’t working, you can check out our list of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-face-id-not-working-or-not-available-on-iphone/" >solutions for Face ID not working <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="6-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-Overheating-Issues"><a href="#6-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-Overheating-Issues" class="headerlink" title="6. iPhone 13 Pro Max Overheating Issues"></a>6. iPhone 13 Pro Max Overheating Issues</h2><p> If your iPhone 13 is overheating, it might be from overuse. While in most cases, you’ll likely need to send your iPhone 13 in for repairs if it’s overheating, there are a few tweaks you can try beforehand. These are also useful for other battery issues, but they can sometimes help to solve overheating.</p><p> First, consider tweaking a few of your iPhone 13’s battery settings. This includes lowering the brightness, disabling Background App Refresh, and turning off Location Services. These changes reduce the overall processing power required by your iPhone, reducing the load on your battery.</p><p> If your iPhone 13 is still overheating after these changes, try resetting all settings and restarting your phone. And if that doesn’t help either, you’ll likely have to send your iPhone 13 in for repair.</p><h2 id="Solving-the-Top-iPhone-13-Problems"><a href="#Solving-the-Top-iPhone-13-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Solving the Top iPhone 13 Problems"></a>Solving the Top iPhone 13 Problems</h2><p> While every new generation of iPhones comes with impressive hardware and software, none of them are immune to bugs and problems. iPhone 13 issues are relatively common. Luckily, there are a few ways you can solve these issues without sending your phone in for repair.</p><p> More often than not, a restart or factory reset can solve most of the bugs or problems.

Despite the fact that you can’t physically open your AirPods or go into the settings on the diminutive headphones, there are still plenty of troubleshooting steps you can take to fix audio issues.</p><p> So, before you spend a bunch of time chatting to Apple’s technical support, here’s how to fix AirPods sound problems for yourself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nGlyEL5K6Y?si=3KZhTTBvKcPmyS68" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Update-Your-iPhone-iPad-or-Mac"><a href="#1-Update-Your-iPhone-iPad-or-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1.

Update Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac</h2><p> The first step you should take is to update the operating system for whatever device your AirPods are paired to, be it an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Android device, or Windows PC.</p><p> These updates are the best way to fix widespread bugs that have emerged, which might be causing the problems with your AirPods. Just use the relevant link below to learn how to update your device:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >Update an iPhone or iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-apple-watch/" >Update an Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-mac-software/" >Update a Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-your-android-phone/" >Update an Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-windows-software-guide/" >Update a Windows PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="2-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware"><a href="#2-Update-Your-AirPods-Firmware" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is a little trickier to do because there’s no “Update Firmware” button. Instead, follow our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-airpods/" >update the firmware on your AirPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Take a moment to learn about <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-disable-dynamic-head-tracking-iphone/" >Dynamic Head Tracking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which moves the sound in your AirPods as you turn your head so that it always sounds like it’s coming from your paired device.</p><p> If you’ve ruled out Dynamic Head Tracking, there might be an issue with your Accessibility settings:</p><ol><li>Pair your AirPods to an iPhone or iPad and go to<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio&#x2F;Visual</strong> .</li><li>Scroll down to<strong>Balance</strong> .</li><li>Ensure the slider is set to<strong>0.00</strong> in the middle.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/General-settings-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="General settings on iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Accssibility-settings-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Accssibility settings on iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AudioVisual-settings-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Audio:Visual settings on iPhone"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="4-Recharge-Your-AirPods-and-Charging-Case"><a href="#4-Recharge-Your-AirPods-and-Charging-Case" class="headerlink" title="4.

It’s a good way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apple-airpods-problems-fix/" >fix all manner of AirPods problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> So, return your AirPods to the case and connect it to a charging cable until it’s fully charged.

Reset the Volume and Re-Pair Your AirPods</h2><p> You can fix various problems, like when <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-make-airpods-louder/" >the audio is too quiet on AirPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , by unpairing and re-pairing the headphones.

This could be caused by a weak signal or interference from other devices and appliances. To troubleshoot your Bluetooth connection, make sure your AirPods are close to the device they’re paired with. Stay in the same room, and try not to let any big object get in between the two.</p><p> If your audio is still glitchy, try moving away from any objects that might interfere with your Bluetooth connection. These could include:</p><ul><li>Poorly shielded cables</li><li>Microwaves</li><li>Wi-Fi routers</li></ul><p> Lastly, try using the AirPods with a different device to see if the Bluetooth problems were with your original device, rather than the AirPods. Needless to say, if your AirPods audio is glitchy no matter which device you use them with, then you know that you’re dealing with an AirPods problem.</p><p> If you do discover that one particular device is causing problems with your AirPods, try disconnecting any other Bluetooth devices from it (including an Apple Watch), then try toggling Bluetooth on and off or resetting the device entirely to fix it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Wi-Fi-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Wi-Fi-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9.

No story reply, group chat gossip, or work call will reach you as long as you have Do Not Disturb mode enabled on your iPhone.</p><p> However, if you’re still getting texts and calls on Do Not Disturb, it pretty much defeats the purpose of the feature. So, let’s look at the steps you can take when Do Not Disturb is not working on your iPhone.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YezPJZzPJ8Q?si=xF1t4BQHFquzvnzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode"><a href="#1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1.

Focus includes Do Not Disturb, Personal, Work, and so on. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/focus-mode-ideas-to-set-up-in-ios/" >set up different Focus modes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and customize them for different purposes.</p><p> If you accidentally enabled<strong>Work</strong> mode instead of<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> or<strong>Personal</strong> mode on your iPhone, you will certainly receive texts and calls from work colleagues because the latter wasn’t made to deter people from your workplace.</p><p> Therefore, before proceeding with the other suggestions in the list, access your iPhone’s<strong>Control Center</strong> and check that you have the correct Focus mode turned on to match your activity.</p><h2 id="2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps"><a href="#2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2. Review Your Allowed Apps"></a>2. Review Your Allowed Apps</h2><p> Do Not Disturb lets you choose which app you want to receive notifications from, even when it’s enabled. For example, when working, you naturally wouldn’t want to miss notifications from collaborative apps like Slack and Asana.</p><p> But if you feel that Do Not Disturb is not working as it should, and you’re left wondering why you’re still getting notifications from apps you don’t want to hear from, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Apps</strong> to review the apps with allowed notifications.</p><p> Then, tap the<strong>minus (-)</strong> button to remove an unwanted app from the list. This way, it won’t bypass your Do Not Disturb mode anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/focus-modes.JPEG"                      alt="focus modes on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aG3NRuHrIJg?si=HwzwD0RXmrzIXX1V" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-apps.JPEG"                      alt="allowed apps on do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications"><a href="#3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications" class="headerlink" title="3.

Disable Time-Sensitive Notifications</h2><p> Examples of time-sensitive notifications are reminders, emails, or messages that contain references to date and time. So, for instance, even if the<strong>Messages</strong> app is not in your list of Allowed Apps, an iPhone text message may still pass through Do Not Disturb due to the nature of its content, thus making it seem that Do Not Disturb is not working on your iPhone.</p><p> If you don’t want to receive such notifications, go to your<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> settings in the<strong>Settings</strong> app. Tap<strong>Apps</strong> and toggle off<strong>Time-Sensitive Notifications</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3-3.jpg"                      alt="disable time sensitive notifications for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxv4NM-89CU?si=Uj5rOkhrwZ_6QIuW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Alternatively, you can tap<strong>Turn Off</strong> for a specific app if you see its notifications pop up on your Lock Screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dR4tF3VgyU?si=AJipgqZsNNxsRsBW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Change-Settings-for-Incoming-Calls"><a href="#4-Change-Settings-for-Incoming-Calls" class="headerlink" title="4. Change Settings for Incoming Calls"></a>4. Change Settings for Incoming Calls</h2><p> When you first enable Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone,<strong>Favorites</strong> tends to be the default setting for the incoming calls allowed. If you previously added quite a few family members and friends to your Favorites list, this may be why your iPhone calls are coming through even after you enabled Do Not Disturb, as if it’s not working.</p><p> To change this, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt; People</strong> . Now, tap on<strong>Allow Calls From</strong> and select your preferred option. If you want to only allow specific individuals to call you during Do Not Disturb mode, choose<strong>Allowed People Only</strong> and tap the<strong>Add</strong> button above to select your contacts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp78eFEGwVU?si=-4orJBLvJJrggCJ2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-favorite-calls.JPEG"                      alt="call settings for do not disturb mode on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-calls.JPEG"                      alt="change calls allowed on iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls"><a href="#5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Allow Repeated Calls"></a>5. Don’t Allow Repeated Calls</h2><p> If someone calls you more than once in a three-minute timespan, Do Not Disturb lets their call come through, regardless of the incoming call preferences you indicated earlier. This feature ensures that people can reach you in cases of emergencies, and it’s not because Do Not Disturb is not working.</p><p> But if there are people who call you mindlessly the moment you don’t pick up, and this feature ends up giving you more problems than convenience, you can choose to disable it. As outlined in the previous solution, go to the<strong>People</strong> settings in<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> . Then, toggle off<strong>Allow Repeated Calls</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2-2.jpg"                      alt="turn off allow repeated calls for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><h2 id="6-Turn-Off-or-Hide-Your-Focus-Status"><a href="#6-Turn-Off-or-Hide-Your-Focus-Status" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn Off or Hide Your Focus Status"></a>6. Turn Off or Hide Your Focus Status</h2><p> When you turn on Do Not Disturb, you can also share your Focus status to let your contacts know that you’re temporarily unavailable.</p><p> While it’s a thoughtful feature that helps you inform others, a downside is its accompanying Notify Anyway option, which lets people override your Do Not Disturb mode. This causes text messages and calls to come through your iPhone.</p><p> To stop receiving texts and calls in this manner, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-notify-anyway-focus-mode-iphone/" >turn off your Focus status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-hide-focus-status-from-certain-contacts-iphone/" >hide your Focus status from certain iPhone contacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Review-Your-Do-Not-Disturb-Schedule"><a href="#7-Review-Your-Do-Not-Disturb-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="7. Review Your Do Not Disturb Schedule"></a>7. Review Your Do Not Disturb Schedule</h2><p> Let’s say you used to work morning shifts every day and had set your Do Not Disturb schedule to match. If you suddenly switch to afternoon shifts, you may feel that Do Not Disturb is not working because you’re receiving unwanted texts and calls on your iPhone during your new working hours.</p><p> However, it’s simply because of your old Do Not Disturb schedule, which automatically turns off in the evening, as per your original setting. So, if there’s a change in your routine, remember to check and adjust your Do Not Disturb schedule to fit accordingly.</p><p> Head to your<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> settings and tap on your existing schedule to edit it. You can also tap<strong>Add Schedule</strong> to set a new time to turn on Do Not Disturb.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-schedule.JPEG"                      alt="schedule for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-schedule-2.JPEG"                      alt="automate schedule for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-change-schedule.JPEG"                      alt="set time for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="8-Restart-Your-iPhone-and-Update-iOS"><a href="#8-Restart-Your-iPhone-and-Update-iOS" class="headerlink" title="8.

Since you lost your iPhone, you have two options to access the Find My network.</p><p> Find My is enabled on iPhones by default. However, if you disabled this setting before you lost your iPhone, it won’t appear on Apple’s Find My network.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Your-Other-Apple-Devices"><a href="#1-Use-Your-Other-Apple-Devices" class="headerlink" title="1.

It doesn’t matter if you use someone else’s device for this as long as you remember to sign out afterward.</p><p> Open any web browser on any device, head to <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/find/" >icloud.com&#x2F;find <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and sign in with your Apple ID.

This would happen when someone powers on the device or if it connects to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth again.</p><p> To set this up in Find My, select the missing iPhone and toggle on<strong>Notify When Found</strong> . On a Mac, you need to select your offline device and click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to it on the map to access the<strong>Notify When Found</strong> toggle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/toggling-notify-when-found.png"                      alt="toggling Notify When Found"                ></p><p> The Find My app will send you a notification, and Apple will email you the location of your lost or stolen iPhone as soon as it goes online.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/97ydpSmzTJw?si=tFcelmtQX4u-b3u5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Get-Directions-to-Your-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Get-Directions-to-Your-Lost-or-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Get Directions to Your Lost or Stolen iPhone"></a>Get Directions to Your Lost or Stolen iPhone</h3><p> If your lost iPhone or iPad is online, you can use the Find My app to get directions to its location. Select your device in Find My and hit<strong>Directions</strong> . On a Mac, you need to select your iPhone in Find My, then click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to it on the map to access this option.</p><p> Apple Maps will launch and load a route from your current location to your lost device. Unfortunately, you won’t find this option in Find My’s web client.

Instead, follow the instructions below to enable Lost Mode and contact law enforcement agencies to tell them where it is.</p><h3 id="Play-a-Sound-to-Find-Your-Missing-iPhone"><a href="#Play-a-Sound-to-Find-Your-Missing-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Play a Sound to Find Your Missing iPhone"></a>Play a Sound to Find Your Missing iPhone</h3><p> The Find My app only offers a vague location for your lost iPhone. This might help you narrow it down to work, home, or the supermarket. But you’ll still struggle to find it if it’s tucked beneath a couch cushion or at the bottom of the laundry basket.</p><p> Fortunately, you can use Find My to make your iPhone play a loud sound, making it easier to find when you’re nearby.</p><p> You’ll find the<strong>Play Sound</strong> button once you select your missing iPhone in Find My, whether you’re using the web client or the native app on iPhone or iPad. On a Mac, remember to click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button after selecting it to access this option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/playing-sound-in-find-my-app.png"                      alt="playing sound in find my app"                ></p><p> Your iPhone will keep playing a sound until you find and unlock it or someone else powers off the device. Not that your iPhone must be connected to the internet for this to work.</p><h3 id="Enable-Lost-Mode-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Enable-Lost-Mode-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Enable Lost Mode if You Still Can’t Find Your iPhone"></a>Enable Lost Mode if You Still Can’t Find Your iPhone</h3><p> It’s always a good idea to enable Lost Mode if you can’t get your hands on your missing iPhone right away.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-apple-lost-mode/" >The Lost Mode option on Find My <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suspends Apple Pay and locks your device. And if your missing iPhone doesn’t have a passcode set, you’ll be prompted to create one.</p><p> You can also use Lost Mode to display a message on the screen telling whoever finds it that this device belongs to you, along with details on how to reach you. Your device will still receive phone calls in Lost Mode, but it won’t display any alerts.</p><p> To enable Lost Mode, select your device in Find My and hit<strong>Activate</strong> under the<strong>Mark As Lost</strong> option. Then, follow the prompts to create a passcode (if you don’t already have one) and write a message for people to see when they find your iPhone. Then, choose<strong>Activate</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/marking-device-as-lost.png"                      alt="marking device as lost in Find My"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eu4vwlZcMvM?si=4vEczfVU4BUUFP-t" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lost Mode keeps your data intact.

However, you should only use this option if you never expect to find your missing device again.</p><p> Once you use Find My to erase a missing iPhone, you can’t track its location anymore. No one else can use your device because it’s locked to your Apple ID with Activation Lock. But you’re unlikely to find it again because you can’t use Find My to see where it is.</p><p> We only recommend this option if you’ve given up on ever getting your device back. You’ll find the<strong>Erase This Device</strong> option at the bottom once you select your iPhone in Find My.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/erasing-lost-iphone.png"                      alt="erasing lost iPhone in Find My"                ></p><p> Keep in mind that your iPhone must be connected to the internet to start this process. Otherwise, you’ll notice that the erase is pending on Find My.</p><p> Apple’s Find My app makes locating a lost or stolen iPhone easy. But this isn’t the only tool at your disposal. In fact, there are other <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-find-your-lost-iphone/" >ways to find your lost iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which can be handy if you have Find My disabled.</p><p> For instance, you can check Google’s timeline, ask friends and family members, or try calling your phone number to listen for the ring if it’s nearby. With these tips, you should be able to get your iPhone back in no time.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-nurturing-a-thriving-community-for-more-insta-views/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Nurturing a Thriving Community for More Insta Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-reactivating-disabled-ios-devices/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to Reactivating Disabled iOS Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/g-youtube-captionssubtitles-made-simple-and-fast-for-2024/"><u>Adding YouTube Captions/Subtitles Made Simple and Fast for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721452569763-fix-your-iphones-charge-on-hold-warning-in-just-8-steps/"><u>Fix Your iPhone's Charge-On-Hold Warning in Just 8 Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/fixing-iphones-troubled-guided-access-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Fixing iPhone's Troubled Guided Access Mode: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-adjust-and-improve-iphone-battery-life-in-just-six-simple-steps/"><u>How To Adjust & Improve iPhone Battery Life In Just Six Simple Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-regain-access-and-fix-imessage-disconnection-alerts-on-iphone-devices/"><u>How to Regain Access and Fix iMessage Disconnection Alerts on iPhone Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/identifying-a-block-understanding-your-imessage-status/"><u>Identifying a Block: Understanding Your iMessage Status</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-watch-hulu-outside-us-on-vivo-y27-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Watch Hulu Outside US On Vivo Y27 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-infusing-your-art-with-captivating-collage-vistas/"><u>In 2024, Infusing Your Art with Captivating Collage Vistas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-will-the-ipogo-get-you-banned-and-how-to-solve-it-on-motorola-g54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Will the iPogo Get You Banned and How to Solve It On Motorola G54 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/integrating-zoom-and-skype-the-ultimate-guide-to-efficient-video-calls-for-2024/"><u>Integrating Zoom and Skype The Ultimate Guide to Efficient Video Calls for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-iphone-reboot-into-recovery-mode-a-complete-walkthrough/"><u>Mastering the Art of iPhone Reboot Into Recovery Mode: A Complete Walkthrough</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-the-chatgpt-api-landscape-insights-and-best-practices-for-developers/"><u>Navigating the ChatGPT API Landscape: Insights and Best Practices for Developers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-imei-unlokers-for-your-honor-magic-5-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top IMEI Unlokers for Your Honor Magic 5 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/ultimate-download-hub-for-social-media-videos-fb-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Download Hub for Social Media Videos (FB) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/ultra-portable-orlink-usb-631-superior-wi-fi-connectivity-compact-design/"><u>Ultra-Portable ORLINK USB 631: Superior Wi-Fi Connectivity, Compact Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/unlock-the-power-of-your-iphone-flashlight-again-with-these-12-fixes/"><u>Unlock the Power of Your iPhone Flashlight Again with These 12 Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/why-doesnt-picture-recognition-work-on-my-iphone-exploring-6-possible-causes/"><u>Why Doesn't Picture Recognition Work on My iPhone?

And if that’s your current experience, you’re lucky we’re here to help.</p><p> There are many reasons AirPlay won’t stream audio or video content from your devices. Sometimes, it could result from a faulty internet connection. Other times, your Apple device won’t properly send content to the desired destination.</p><p> Regardless, you can fix most AirPlay issues using some easy and quick methods. Below, we’ll look at all the possible ways to fix AirPlay when it’s not working.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/td3ojuzhloY?si=N_maQNiJWrJp7XZl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-the-Minimum-Requirements-for-AirPlay"><a href="#1-Check-the-Minimum-Requirements-for-AirPlay" class="headerlink" title="1. Check the Minimum Requirements for AirPlay"></a>1. Check the Minimum Requirements for AirPlay</h2><p> AirPlay doesn’t work on all devices, so you first need to check if the AirPlay sender (the device used to stream content) meets the minimum system requirements for AirPlay.</p><p><strong>AirPlay audio from:</strong></p><ul><li>iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 11.4 or later</li><li>Apple TV HD or Apple TV 4K running tvOS 11.4 or later</li><li>HomePod or HomePod mini running iOS 11.4 or later</li><li>Mac with iTunes 12.8 or later or macOS Catalina 10.15 or later</li><li>Windows PC with iTunes 12.8 or later</li></ul><p><strong>AirPlay video from:</strong></p><ul><li>iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 12.3 or later</li><li>Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.5 or later</li></ul><p> The AirPlay receiver (the device you’re streaming content to) must support the feature, too.</p><p> To confirm a third-party device like a smart TV supports the AirPlay feature, look for an AirPlay-enabled label on the packaging.</p><p> If you’re interested, browse our recommendations of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-airplay-receivers-that-are-cheaper-than-apple-tv/" >best AirPlay receivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Adjust-AirPlay-Receiver-Settings-in-macOS"><a href="#2-Adjust-AirPlay-Receiver-Settings-in-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust AirPlay Receiver Settings in macOS"></a>2. Adjust AirPlay Receiver Settings in macOS</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-airplay-to-a-mac/" >Modern Macs running macOS Monterey or later can double as an AirPlay receiver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This makes it possible to AirPlay content from another device to your Mac and even share a Mac’s screen via AirPlay, provided the AirPlay Receiver setting is turned on, as discussed below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-iphone-15-pro-airplay-video-to-mac.jpg"                      alt="iPhone 15 Pro Mac AirPlaying video to a Mac"                ></p><p> To protect your privacy, only devices that use the same Apple ID as your computer are permitted to AirPlay content to your Mac. To change that, venture into<strong>System Settings &gt; General &gt; AirDrop &amp; HandOff</strong> and turn on the<strong>AirPlay Receiver</strong> setting on the right.</p><p> Now, even devices that don’t use the same Apple ID as your Mac can AirPlay to it. To permit any nearby devices to see your Mac as an AirPlay receiver, click<strong>Allow AirPlay for</strong> , choose<strong>Everyone</strong> from the menu, and then click the<strong>Allow Everyone</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-macos-sonoma-system-settings-allow-airplay-for-everyone-menu-option.jpg"                      alt="System Settings on macOS Sonoma displaying the Allow AirPlay for everyone option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaGNHfAT92w?si=bvHo1iYK2JBIPtRo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> You can also let new devices AirPlay to your Mac without password verification by turning off the<strong>Require password</strong> option.</p><p> Apple recommends using an iPhone 7 or later and at least a 2018 Mac for an ideal experience. However, you can still use AirPlay on older devices at a lower video resolution. For example, we could AirPlay from an iPhone 6s, which isn’t on Apple’s compatibility list.</p><h2 id="3-Wake-Devices-and-Keep-Them-Close"><a href="#3-Wake-Devices-and-Keep-Them-Close" class="headerlink" title="3. Wake Devices and Keep Them Close"></a>3. Wake Devices and Keep Them Close</h2><p> If it wasn’t clear enough, remember that all your devices must be turned on and unlocked to use AirPlay. When using AirPlay on your Apple TV, ensure the device isn’t in sleep mode by clicking the remote to wake it from sleep.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-airplay-audio-menu.jpg"                      alt="AirPlay menu on iPhone 15 Pro Max listing nearby devices"                ></p><p> Since AirPlay typically relies on peer-to-peer discovery, bring them as close to each other as possible to increase the connection strength.</p><h2 id="4-Enable-Screen-Mirroring-in-the-Menu-Bar"><a href="#4-Enable-Screen-Mirroring-in-the-Menu-Bar" class="headerlink" title="4. Enable Screen Mirroring in the Menu Bar"></a>4. Enable Screen Mirroring in the Menu Bar</h2><p> When your Mac detects an AirPlay receiver on the network, it shows up under the Screen Mirroring icon in the menu bar. If no icon is visible, go to<strong>System Settings &gt; Control Center</strong> , click the menu next to<strong>Screen Mirroring</strong> , and select<strong>Always Show in Menu Bar</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-macos-sonoma-system-settings-control-center-screen-mirroring-always-show-in-menu-bar-selected.jpg"                      alt="macOS Control Center settings with the option to always show Screen Mirroring in the menu bar enabled"                ></p><p> Now, you can quickly start or stop AirPlay, mirror your Mac’s screen, or use a nearby iPad as a second display—all from the menu bar.</p><h2 id="5-Disable-Automatic-AirPlay-to-TVs"><a href="#5-Disable-Automatic-AirPlay-to-TVs" class="headerlink" title="5. Disable Automatic AirPlay to TVs"></a>5. Disable Automatic AirPlay to TVs</h2><p> An iPhone or iPad may automatically AirPlay content to your Apple TV or AirPlay-compatible smart TV every time you use the feature. To stop that from happening, go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; AirPlay &amp; Handoff &gt; Automatically AirPlay</strong> and choose<strong>Never</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-ios-17-settings-app-airplay-and-handoff-section-highlighted.jpg"                      alt="Apple iOS 17 Settings App Airplay and Handoff Section Highlighted"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpdGEJJwMLY?si=eKgXOPpNeYvYKcel" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-ios-17-settings-app-airplay-and-handoff-section-automatically-airplay-highlighted.jpg"                      alt="Apple iOS 17 Settings App Airplay and Handoff Section Automatically AirPlay Highlighted"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-ios-17-settings-app-airplay-and-handoff-section-automatically-airplay-never-highlighted.jpg"                      alt="iOS 17 AirPlay settings with the Automatically AirPlay option set to Never"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un9G2_OdSRI?si=vAcGbco8DuWt4ypP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> Doing so shall stop your iPhone from automatically connecting to a nearby AirPlay receiver like your Apple TV whenever you want to cast something on your Mac.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4R7_qNIQvY?si=2zJOPfEcm6_3udzn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Turn-Off-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#6-Turn-Off-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn Off Airplane Mode"></a>6. Turn Off Airplane Mode</h2><p> Enabling Airplane Mode on an iPhone or iPad turns off all wireless radios except Bluetooth. AirPlay requires both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you’ll need to quit Airplane Mode to use AirPlay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-ios-17-settings-app-airplane-mode-disabled.jpg"                      alt="Closeup of iPhone&#39;s Settings app with Airplane Mode disabled"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPoakxUNf9o?si=S-ppSqzHzN9VrxC7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Open the Control Center on your iPhone or iPad by swiping down from the top-right corner, then touch a little airplane icon to toggle Airplane Mode. Alternatively, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Airplane Mode</strong> to turn the feature on or off.</p><h2 id="7-Switch-on-Bluetooth"><a href="#7-Switch-on-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="7. Switch on Bluetooth"></a>7. Switch on Bluetooth</h2><p> Bluetooth must be enabled on both ends to allow the sender and receiver to discover each other. You can turn on Bluetooth on an iPhone and iPad in a couple of ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-ios-17-settings-app-bluetooth-section-disabled-highlighted.jpg"                      alt="iOS 17 Settings with the Bluetooth section highlighted and disabled"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-ios-17-settings-app-bluetooth-enabled.jpg"                      alt="iOS 17 Settings with Bluetooth enabled"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> One way is to pull down from the top-right corner and enable the<strong>Bluetooth</strong> toggle in the Control Center. Alternatively, you can go to<strong>Settings &gt; Bluetooth</strong> on your iPhone and use the toggle to disable the feature.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHafwnWSEQk?si=rejNVNpJZH2SqNLy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Use-the-Same-Wi-Fi-Network"><a href="#8-Use-the-Same-Wi-Fi-Network" class="headerlink" title="8.

It comes pre-installed on almost every Apple device, and it’s designed to be fast and efficient for them. However, there are times when Safari doesn’t work.</p><p> When this happens, it usually means there’s a setting or software issue. There are even cases where you might not be able to access the internet at all on your iPhone or iPad. Luckily, there are a variety of things you can try to get Safari working again.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your Device"></a>1. Restart Your Device</h2><p> You hear it all the time—turn your device off and on again. While this may sound too simple to work, restarting your iPhone or iPad has been known to clear your usable memory, which can speed up Safari.</p><p> If Safari is frozen or just a blank white screen, restarting your iPhone or iPad can also fix these problems. Before you try anything else, just make sure you cover the basics.</p><p> If you’re new to Safari or Apple devices, you might want to check out our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/safari-beginners-guide-iphone/" >beginner’s guide to Safari for iPhone and iPad users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dOmuXhsV6Y?si=aT6vgPbDx4ajjvdr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Turn-Off-Safari-Suggestions"><a href="#2-Turn-Off-Safari-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn Off Safari Suggestions"></a>2. Turn Off Safari Suggestions</h2><p> Turning off Safari Suggestions is one of the simplest and most common fixes for Safari not loading or crashing on an Apple device. While we aren’t sure why this works, many users have reported that turning this off fixes the problem.</p><p> To turn off suggestions, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari Suggestions</strong> and turn this off. You can also turn off<strong>Search Engine Suggestions</strong> while you’re there too, as some users reported this also fixes the issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/safari-suggestions.jpg"                      alt="safari suggestions"                ></p><p> Some users have also said that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/allow-or-block-browser-pop-ups-on-iphone/" >blocking Safari popups on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can improve the memory usage of Safari. So, you may also want to give this a try.</p><p> If this fixes your issue, then you’re all set. If not, try the following steps.</p><h2 id="3-Turn-On-Cellular-Data-for-Safari"><a href="#3-Turn-On-Cellular-Data-for-Safari" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn On Cellular Data for Safari"></a>3. Turn On Cellular Data for Safari</h2><p> If you’re frequently connected to Wi-Fi, you may have cellular data off for Safari to save internet data. While helpful, if your Wi-Fi isn’t functioning right, connecting to cellular data could fix your issue.</p><p> To do this, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Cellular</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari</strong> and turn this on. If it was off, this was most likely the cause of your issue. Alternatively, you can turn off Wi-Fi if you’re connected and just connect with cellular data. If you can connect this way, that means there’s a network issue with your Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/safari-cellular-data.jpg"                      alt="safari cellular data"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7AYCS7zBU0?si=7R9oIpE4hyEbtk3x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Edit-Your-Screen-Time-Settings"><a href="#4-Edit-Your-Screen-Time-Settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit Your Screen Time Settings"></a>4. Edit Your Screen Time Settings</h2><p> If you’ve ever changed your Screen Time settings or blocked certain websites through Screen Time, try turning these settings off. To block websites, you need to enable<strong>Content Restrictions</strong> which can inadvertently block websites you still want to use. If you can’t load a link from an email or text message, this could also be a sign that content restrictions are on.</p><p> To fix this issue, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Screen Time</strong> &gt;<strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong> and turn this option off. If it was on, then this was most likely your issue. If it was off already, proceed to the next fix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/screentime-content-privacy.jpg"                      alt="screentime content privacy"                ></p><h2 id="5-Clear-All-Safari’s-Data"><a href="#5-Clear-All-Safari’s-Data" class="headerlink" title="5. Clear All Safari’s Data"></a>5. Clear All Safari’s Data</h2><p> If you frequently use Safari, you might have a lot of data stored within the app, making it fail to load correctly. This is especially true if you’re using an iPhone or iPad with a lower storage capacity. If you get low storage notifications, this fix could resolve your issue.</p><p> To clear Safari’s data, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari</strong> &gt;<strong>Clear History and Website Data</strong> . This will erase all extra data in the Safari app. Some users report this works, but you’ll need to do it often if you can’t eliminate storage space elsewhere on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/clear-safari-history.jpg"                      alt="clear safari history"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAnyQ0uj9Yg?si=Es4_ulcdM_-LuDcq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Update-iOS-to-the-Latest-Version"><a href="#6-Update-iOS-to-the-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="6. Update iOS to the Latest Version"></a>6. Update iOS to the Latest Version</h2><p> Some users have reported that updating iOS resolves issues with Safari. Whether Safari isn’t loading, is crashing, or just isn’t connecting to websites, try <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-you-need-to-update-ios/" >updating iOS on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Apple does a great job of fixing widespread issues with iOS updates. So, if there is an issue that Apple is aware of, it could get fixed by a subsequent update.</p><h2 id="7-Reset-Your-Network-Settings"><a href="#7-Reset-Your-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="7. Reset Your Network Settings"></a>7. Reset Your Network Settings</h2><p> If you’ve had issues with your network before, like not getting service or pages timing out, resetting your Network Settings could help.</p><p> To reset the Network Settings on your iPhone or iPad, head to<strong>Settings &gt; General</strong> &gt;<strong>Transfer or Reset iPhone (iPad)</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> . This will reset only your Network Settings and won’t erase any other data on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reset-network-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="reset iphone network settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UyJuZYzjt0?si=W87GeyzVKVORAk7S" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> After you finish this, try opening Safari to see if it’s working again.

This will erase all the data on your iPhone, and you’ll have to set it up from scratch. However, this is also a very effective way to resolve all kinds of software problems. To do this, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>General</strong> &gt;<strong>Transfer or Reset iPhone (iPad)</strong> &gt;<strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/erase-all-content-1.jpg"                      alt="erase all content and settings"                ></p><p> After resetting to the default settings, test out the Safari app before you install your usual apps.

If you restored a backup, there could be something interfering with Safari that transferred over. If you reset your device without a backup and Safari still doesn’t work, you can try one of the two last troubleshooting steps.</p><h2 id="9-Turn-On-JavaScript"><a href="#9-Turn-On-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="9.

Since the latest iPhone update, some users have reported that Spotify crashes when they lock your phone. This means that in order to listen to music or podcasts, you need to keep your phone unlocked.</p><p> This seems to be some sort of power-saving glitch, or potentially a bad interaction between the Spotify app and the latest version of iOS. Either way, this guide will show you the potential solutions to fix this problem.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Delete-the-Cache"><a href="#1-Delete-the-Cache" class="headerlink" title="1.

There is a reason for this—the issue happens when you frequently download podcasts or songs for offline listening. If you don’t clear these up, the issue is more likely to happen to you, and podcast fans are more likely to download new content as each new episode comes out.</p><p> You can clear up all downloaded data by going to your<strong>Spotify</strong> app, tapping on<strong>My Library</strong> , and tapping on the<strong>Downloaded</strong> tab. Here, you can see all of your downloaded podcasts or songs, and you can delete the ones you’ve already listened to.</p><p>In most cases, this fixes the issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoBCgLTmznE?si=MXXiGsd2qpd_DrzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Reinstall-Spotify-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#3-Reinstall-Spotify-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3.

From the<strong>Your Episodes</strong> page, tap the gear icon and tap<strong>Remove played episodes</strong> . Here, you can set them to be automatically removed.</p><p> That way you can forget about deleting them yourself without needing to worry about Spotify not working with iOS again.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-slides-with-youtube-content/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Slides with YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/detailed-tutorial-how-to-address-the-not-found-d3dx924dll-file-problem/"><u>Detailed Tutorial: How to Address the Not Found d3dx9_24.dll File Problem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/expert-tips-for-designing-text-in-3d-space-ps-for-2024/"><u>Expert Tips for Designing Text in 3D Space PS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-regain-access-to-accurate-location-tracking-on-your-iphone-comprehensive-solutions/"><u>How to Regain Access to Accurate Location Tracking on Your iPhone – Comprehensive Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-honor-x9a-pattern-lock-if-forgotten-6-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Honor X9a Pattern Lock if Forgotten? 6 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-vivo-y27-5g-pattern-lock-if-forgotten-6-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Vivo Y27 5G Pattern Lock if Forgotten? 6 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-solving-iphone-n-th-3s-most-frequent-glitches/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Solving iPhone N Th-3's Most Frequent Glitches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/top-6-causes-of-iphone-sluggishness-and-solutions/"><u>Top 6 Causes of iPhone Sluggishness & Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/unravel-the-secrets-to-steady-sounds-stop-head-movement-control-on-airpods-today/"><u>Unravel the Secrets to Steady Sounds - Stop Head Movement Control on AirPods Today!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Solve iPhone&#x2F;iPad Wi-Fi Connectivity with These 8 Tips</h2><p> Since you need a network connection to make the most of your iPhone or iPad, it’s frustrating when your device won’t connect to Wi-Fi. You’ll instead have to use your data plan, which might be limited. And a Wi-Fi-only iPad doesn’t have any other options for getting online.</p><p> Let’s walk through the steps to fix the problem when your iPhone or iPad isn’t connecting to Wi-Fi.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Check-the-Wi-Fi-Menu-on-Your-iPad-or-iPhone"><a href="#1-Check-the-Wi-Fi-Menu-on-Your-iPad-or-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1.

Check the Wi-Fi Menu on Your iPad or iPhone</h2><p> First, you should check to see if the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to is within range and already connected. Open the<strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone or iPad to begin.</p><p> There, take a look at the<strong>Airplane Mode</strong> slider.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-airplane-mode/" >Having airplane mode enabled turns off all wireless communication <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so your device won’t connect to Wi-Fi properly when it’s on.</p><p> Because of this, toggling airplane mode on and back off can be a useful troubleshooting step when your device won’t connect to Wi-Fi.

You should be brought to a sign-in page, where you’ll be required to tap a button to confirm that you agree to the network’s terms of service.</p><p> After you do this, the Wi-Fi network should work properly, though keep in mind that some functions, like games and media streaming, may still be blocked on that network.</p><h2 id="5-Check-Your-Wi-Fi-Network-for-Issues"><a href="#5-Check-Your-Wi-Fi-Network-for-Issues" class="headerlink" title="5.

If you’re able to connect to Wi-Fi successfully at a friend’s house or a coffee shop, then the problem is with your home network. But if your iPhone won’t connect to Wi-Fi anywhere, then something on your device is the problem.</p><p> In this case, head to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings</strong> . This will set everything network-related on your iPhone, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and any VPNs, back to their default options. It’s a bit of a pain to set everything back up, but it’s the final troubleshooting step to weed out strange problems on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/transfer-or-reset-iphone-in-ios-15.PNG"                      alt="Transfer or Reset iPhone in iOS 15"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/all-reset-options-in-iphone-settings.PNG"                      alt="All Reset Options in iPhone Settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If your iPhone or iPad still won’t connect to any Wi-Fi networks after resetting network settings, you should contact <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/" >Apple Support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Below, we look at some troubleshooting tips you can try when events are not showing up in the Calendar app.</p><h2 id="1-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-All-Events"><a href="#1-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-All-Events" class="headerlink" title="1.

Ensure Your Calendar Is Syncing All Events</h2><p> If you’re using a non-iCloud account on your phone, your Calendar may have trouble finding your past events. You might also face this problem if you created the event on a different device.</p><p> The trick is to make sure you sync and show more than just the events that happened in the last few weeks or months. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> , scroll down, and tap on<strong>Calendar</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Sync</strong> and choose<strong>All Events</strong> from the list of available options.</li><li>Now, wait for a minute and launch the Calendar app. Then, tap<strong>Calendars</strong> at the bottom and swipe down from the top to refresh all your calendars.</li></ol><p> If the<strong>All Events</strong> option is already selected, you can choose any of the other timeframes, restart the Calendar app, then select<strong>All Events</strong> again.​​​</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-settings-page-3.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Settings page"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendar-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of iPhone calendar settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendar-sync-settings-2.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendar sync settings-2"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendars-tab.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendars tab"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEqoiNArwjQ?si=oaL_lgnI-RxY5Qy_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPoakxUNf9o?si=S-ppSqzHzN9VrxC7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-With-iCloud"><a href="#2-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-With-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can set up a shared calendar that lets you and your partner schedule date nights, for example, while also making a work calendar that helps you organize your meetings.</p><p> So, there’s a chance your events are missing because they belong to a different group.

Head to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboards &gt; Add a New Keyboard</strong> , then find and select<strong>Emoji</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3-add-new-keyboard-in-iphone-general-settings.jpg"                      alt="Add New Keyboard in iPhone General Settings."                ></p><p> Now, make sure the<strong>Predictive</strong> function is enabled. Go back to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard</strong> , then scroll down and enable the<strong>Predictive</strong> toggle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4-predictive-option-enabled-in-iphone-settings.jpg"                      alt="Predictive option enabled in iPhone settings."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qObsqoJB9LI?si=ppqxfXzP0UL4J6Tp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNxZ4Z6BVCg?si=522oz1OPSQDhNYWT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Switch-to-Apple’s-English-Keyboard"><a href="#2-Switch-to-Apple’s-English-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you’re using a third-party keyboard, try switching back to the official Apple one.</p><p> To do this, tap and hold the<strong>Emoji</strong> or<strong>Globe</strong> icon in the bottom-left corner of your keyboard, then select the<strong>English</strong> keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-selecting-english-keyboard-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Selecting English keyboard on an iPhone."                ></p><p> Make sure the keyboard language matches what you’re typing, otherwise it won’t know which emojis to predict.</p><h2 id="3-Feed-Your-Device-With-Emojis"><a href="#3-Feed-Your-Device-With-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="3. Feed Your Device With Emojis"></a>3. Feed Your Device With Emojis</h2><p> Your iPhone or iPad feeds on the information you give it and makes suggestions based on your typing style and past usage. If you don’t use emojis much in a certain app, that may be the reason you’re not getting any predictive emoji suggestions in it.</p><p> You need to let your iPhone or iPad know that you like using emojis for it to start predicting them. To do that, open the app that doesn’t show you predictive emojis and tap the<strong>Emoji</strong> icon in the bottom-left corner to select the<strong>Emoji</strong> keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6-emoji-keyboard-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Emoji keyboard on an iPhone."                ></p><p> Now start typing random emojis. They don’t need to make sense, but you need to add enough of them to teach your device that you like using emojis in this app. It could take 20 or more emojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/7-typing-random-emojis-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Typing random emojis on an iPhone."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUDdKOsEN74?si=tkZf-KVinjuwmgx9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now delete all the content you just typed and check if Predictive Emoji is working by typing a word like “puppy,” “candy,” or “haha.” You should see emoji suggestions above the keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8-predictive-emoji-showing-laughing-options.jpg"                      alt="Predictive Emoji showing laughing options."                ></p><p> You should repeat this process for every app where predictive emoji is not working.</p><h2 id="4-Reset-Your-Keyboard-Dictionary"><a href="#4-Reset-Your-Keyboard-Dictionary" class="headerlink" title="4. Reset Your Keyboard Dictionary"></a>4. Reset Your Keyboard Dictionary</h2><p> If predictive emojis still aren’t working, you should try resetting your keyboard dictionary. This will make your iPhone or iPad forget any words you’ve taught it, so you may need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-bad-autocorrect-entries-train-iphone-spell-properly/" >fix autocorrect errors on your Apple devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> again.

Now tap<strong>Reset &gt; Reset Keyboard Dictionary</strong> . You’ll need to enter your passcode, then confirm you want to<strong>Reset Dictionary</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/9-reset-option-in-iphone-settings.jpg"                      alt="Reset option in iPhone settings."                ></p><p> Now go back to the previous step and teach your iPhone or iPad that you like using emojis in all the relevant apps again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfEPmG_O6F8?si=93ZTVtH_zjFRz5eh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Delete-Your-Emoji-Keyboard"><a href="#5-Delete-Your-Emoji-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="5.

To do this go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard</strong> . Tap<strong>Keyboards</strong> , then swipe left on the<strong>Emoji</strong> option and hit<strong>Delete</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/10-deleting-emoji-keyboard-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Deleting Emoji keyboard on an iPhone."                ></p><p> Tap<strong>Add New Keyboard</strong> , then select<strong>Emoji</strong> to add it again.</p><h2 id="6-Restart-Your-iPhone-or-iPad"><a href="#6-Restart-Your-iPhone-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="6.

Apple’s Predictive Emoji feature is a handy tool that intuitively suggests emojis that you can seamlessly insert into your conversations. So it’s a big loss to easy texting when that feature stops working. Hopefully these suggestions fixed that for you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/lair-and-finesse-in-your-gaming-youtube-channel/"><u>[New] Flair and Finesse in Your Gaming YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-25-capture-apps-for-your-windows-10-device/"><u>[New] Top 25 Capture Apps for Your Windows 10 Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-exclusive-spotlight-on-tone-treasures-websites/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Exclusive Spotlight on Tone Treasures Websites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-minecrafts-geometric-forms-circular-and-spherical-creation/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Minecraft's Geometric Forms Circular & Spherical Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/breaking-free-from-iphones-persistent-headset-setting-8-clever-remedies/"><u>Breaking Free From iPhone's Persistent Headset Setting: 8 Clever Remedies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/combat-long-screen-lags-on-iphones-mastering-the-art-of-faster-display-shutdowns/"><u>Combat Long Screen Lags on iPhones – Mastering the Art of Faster Display Shutdowns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/ensure-vivid-gameplay-tips-to-eliminate-darkness-on-obs-captures/"><u>Ensure Vivid Gameplay Tips to Eliminate Darkness on OBS Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-leave-a-life360-group-on-realme-11x-5g-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Leave a Life360 Group On Realme 11X 5G Without Anyone Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-leave-a-life360-group-on-realme-narzo-n55-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Leave a Life360 Group On Realme Narzo N55 Without Anyone Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-get-the-apple-id-verification-code-from-iphone-15-pro-in-the-best-ways-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Get the Apple ID Verification Code From iPhone 15 Pro in the Best Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/solving-the-issue-unexpected-sites-in-screen-time-on-iphone/"><u>Solving the Issue: Unexpected Sites in Screen Time on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-troubleshooting-checklist-for-successfully-starting-tekken/"><u>The Ultimate Troubleshooting Checklist for Successfully Starting Tekken</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-your-iphones-delayed-screen-timeout-top-remedies-revealed/"><u>Troubleshoot Your iPhone's Delayed Screen Timeout - Top Remedies Revealed</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Below, we look at some troubleshooting tips you can try when events are not showing up in the Calendar app.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XIUatTFH0Zw?si=ZCtoBtIy18y2F5Vc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-All-Events"><a href="#1-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-All-Events" class="headerlink" title="1.

Ensure Your Calendar Is Syncing All Events</h2><p> If you’re using a non-iCloud account on your phone, your Calendar may have trouble finding your past events. You might also face this problem if you created the event on a different device.</p><p> The trick is to make sure you sync and show more than just the events that happened in the last few weeks or months. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> , scroll down, and tap on<strong>Calendar</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Sync</strong> and choose<strong>All Events</strong> from the list of available options.</li><li>Now, wait for a minute and launch the Calendar app. Then, tap<strong>Calendars</strong> at the bottom and swipe down from the top to refresh all your calendars.</li></ol><p> If the<strong>All Events</strong> option is already selected, you can choose any of the other timeframes, restart the Calendar app, then select<strong>All Events</strong> again.​​​</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-settings-page-3.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Settings page"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0Ww1YIIUe4?si=cQ-Gkh9UCJABuPZU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendar-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of iPhone calendar settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15Ju8Cb4UZ8?si=5wdiQXdz1BOxIkDH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendar-sync-settings-2.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendar sync settings-2"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendars-tab.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendars tab"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="2-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-With-iCloud"><a href="#2-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-With-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.

Ensure All Your Calendars Are Enabled</h2><p> One of the nifty features of the Calendar app in iOS is the ability to set up several calendars for different purposes. You can set up a shared calendar that lets you and your partner schedule date nights, for example, while also making a work calendar that helps you organize your meetings.</p><p> So, there’s a chance your events are missing because they belong to a different group. You have to make sure all your calendars are enabled to prevent that. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Launch the<strong>Calendar</strong> app and tap<strong>Calendars</strong> at the bottom of your screen.</li><li>Ensure you select the calendar groups that are important and are associated with the missing event.</li><li>Also, ensure you select<strong>Show Declined Events</strong> so any past events you didn’t accept will appear in your search for the missing event.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendars-tab.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendars tab"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-bottom-half-of-calendars-tab.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of bottom half of calendars tab"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="4-Try-Some-General-Troubleshooting-Tips"><a href="#4-Try-Some-General-Troubleshooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="4.

Explore These 7 Resolution Steps</h2><p> Various factors can prevent you from establishing a connection to the VPN server, ranging from unstable internet connection to technical difficulties with the VPN provider.

Also, close any other apps that could interfere with the VPN connection.</li><li>Verify that the VPN app is updated to the latest version.</li></ul><p>If the preliminary checks don’t help, proceed to the remaining fixes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCqHbpxQGP4?si=XGkajFHdqyoKNAFM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Connect-to-an-Alternate-Server"><a href="#2-Connect-to-an-Alternate-Server" class="headerlink" title="2.

Therefore, if you fail to connect to the servers of your VPN provider based in a specific country, try connecting to a different server available.</p><p> Most VPN providers allow connecting to numerous servers across the globe, even if you’re on the free plan. If your app does not offer that or you fail to connect to all servers, try an alternative.</p><h2 id="3-Try-Other-VPN-Apps"><a href="#3-Try-Other-VPN-Apps" class="headerlink" title="3. Try Other VPN Apps"></a>3. Try Other VPN Apps</h2><p> If you’re unable to connect to all the available servers across different countries, there could be a backend or technical issue with your VPN provider. The easiest way to rule out backend issues is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-vpn-iphone-ipad/" >try a different VPN app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , preferably one that is more reliable, and connect to one of its servers.</p><p> If the connection is successful, then your primary VPN provider may be the culprit. While you wait for your VPN provider to resolve the issue, you can continue using the other app.</p><p> However, if you can’t connect to a VPN from the other app as well, there may be an issue with the VPN configuration or your iPhone’s settings. So, apply the remaining fixes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8U3ooyFiAB4?si=yXPQrDhMBEJwN2EZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Delete-the-VPN-Profile"><a href="#4-Delete-the-VPN-Profile" class="headerlink" title="4. Delete the VPN Profile"></a>4. Delete the VPN Profile</h2><p> A VPN profile enables a device to connect to a private network securely. When you connect to a new VPN for the first time, the app asks for permission to create a new VPN profile. When you grant permission, the app creates a profile, which allows the VPN to monitor or filter your iPhone’s network activity.</p><p> The corruption of VPN profiles can also hinder your connection. Therefore, you should delete the existing profile and add it again to rule out this possibility. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Open your iPhone’s Settings app.</li><li>Navigate to<strong>General &gt; VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> .</li><li>Tap on<strong>VPN</strong> .</li><li>Locate the VPN profile associated with your primary VPN, which isn’t connecting.</li><li>Tap the <strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to the relevant VPN profile.</li><li>Tap<strong>Delete VPN</strong> and then tap<strong>Delete</strong> in the confirmation popup.</li><li>When you reopen the VPN app, it will ask for permission to recreate the VPN profile. Grant access and see if it fixes the problem.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/opening-the-general-settings-in-the-settings-app-of-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Opening the General Settings in the Settings App of an iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/navigating-to-the-vpn-and-device-management-settings-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Navigating to the VPN and Device Management Settings on an iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/locating-the-vpn-profile-we-intend-to-delete-in-the-iphone-vpn-and-device-management-settings-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Locating the VPN Profile We Intend to Delete in the iPhone VPN and Device Management Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/deleting-the-vpn-profile-in-the-vpn-and-device-management-settings-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Deleting the VPN Profile in the VPN and Device Management Settings on an iPhone"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If deleting and re-creating your primary VPN profile doesn’t resolve the issue, delete all other VPN profiles you see in the VPN settings menu other than the one you just created. This may resolve the problem.</p><h2 id="5-Change-the-VPN-Protocol"><a href="#5-Change-the-VPN-Protocol" class="headerlink" title="5. Change the VPN Protocol"></a>5. Change the VPN Protocol</h2><p> A VPN protocol consists of rules that determine the encryption used for data and the way information travels between your iPhone and a VPN server. Almost all VPN providers offer multiple VPN protocols and are configured to automatically connect to the most appropriate one based on the use case.</p><p> The default auto mode is generally the best, but it sometimes malfunctions and causes connection problems. If you’ve also been using the default auto settings, manually switch between available protocols. Depending on your VPN provider, you may need to dig into the app’s settings to change the protocol.</p><p> If manually changing the protocol doesn’t resolve the issue, revert the change and switch to auto again.</p><h2 id="6-Reset-Your-iPhone’s-Network-Settings"><a href="#6-Reset-Your-iPhone’s-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6. Reset Your iPhone’s Network Settings"></a>6. Reset Your iPhone’s Network Settings</h2><p> If none of the above fixes have helped resolve the issue,<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-iphone/" >reset your iPhone’s network settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Resetting your network settings deletes network caches and old data records saved on your device, resolving all network issues. Thus, resetting the settings may also fix the VPN connection problem at hand.</p><p> To do this, go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings</strong> . Once you confirm the process with your device passcode, reconnect to the VPN again to see if you can connect successfully this time.</p><p> Since resetting your network settings erases saved Wi-Fi networks, passwords, VPN profiles, and custom firewall rules, you’ll have to configure them all over again. So, use this solution as a last resort.</p><h2 id="7-Ensure-Your-ISP-Isn’t-Blocking-Your-Connection"><a href="#7-Ensure-Your-ISP-Isn’t-Blocking-Your-Connection" class="headerlink" title="7.

To do that, connect to your cellular network or a different Wi-Fi network to see if changing the internet provider fixes the issue.</p><p> If you find that your ISP is the culprit, you may need to try a different VPN app to see if that’s blocked as well. You can also contact your ISP directly to have them look into the issue or switch to a different network provider that doesn’t block VPNs altogether.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlX-G8rBs1w?si=iIhUoWAq5x3YK9rA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Get-Your-VPN-Up-and-Running-Again"><a href="#Get-Your-VPN-Up-and-Running-Again" class="headerlink" title="Get Your VPN Up and Running Again"></a>Get Your VPN Up and Running Again</h2><p> Having trouble connecting to a VPN can be frustrating.

For example, maybe there’s no sound on your iPhone when you receive a call. Or maybe your iPhone speaker doesn’t play any sound even after you adjust the volume.</p><p> Whatever’s going on, let’s look at how you can fix it when there’s no sound on your iPhone.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Test-Your-iPhone’s-Speaker-and-Your-Audio-Devices"><a href="#1-Test-Your-iPhone’s-Speaker-and-Your-Audio-Devices" class="headerlink" title="1. Test Your iPhone’s Speaker and Your Audio Devices"></a>1. Test Your iPhone’s Speaker and Your Audio Devices</h2><p> When your iPhone’s sound is not working, you should first try checking whether it’s a software or hardware problem. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Go to the<strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Select<strong>Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong> .</li><li>Under the<strong>Ringer &amp; Alerts</strong> section, tap and slide the volume slider to the right. This increases the speaker volume.</li><li>If there is sound, your iPhone’s speaker is functional. If not, it’s likely a hardware issue that needs repairing.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-settings.jpg"                      alt="iphone settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sounds-haptics-iphone.jpg"                      alt="sounds and haptics on iphone"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Also, check that it’s not your audio devices, such as AirPods, causing the “no sound” problem. Test this by connecting them to other smartphones or computers. If they’re working like usual, it means that the issue is with your iPhone and you can now focus on solving it through this article. For AirPods issues, read our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apple-airpods-problems-fix/" >how to solve common AirPods problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Clean-Your-iPhone’s-Speakers"><a href="#2-Clean-Your-iPhone’s-Speakers" class="headerlink" title="2. Clean Your iPhone’s Speakers"></a>2. Clean Your iPhone’s Speakers</h2><p> Before moving on to troubleshooting software issues, there may simply be dust and dirt affecting speaker function, causing no sound to play on your iPhone. We have instructions you can follow to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/" >clean your iPhone safely <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-airpods.jpg"                      alt="black iphone and airpods on wooden surface"                ></p><p> If it’s not dust and dirt, try to recall whether you accidentally dropped your iPhone in water recently. While iPhones are water-resistant, water may still get into your speakers. You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/sonic/id986999895" >Sonic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app to eject water from the speakers if this is the case.</p><h2 id="3-Turn-Off-Silent-Mode-and-Do-Not-Disturb"><a href="#3-Turn-Off-Silent-Mode-and-Do-Not-Disturb" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn Off Silent Mode and Do Not Disturb"></a>3. Turn Off Silent Mode and Do Not Disturb</h2><p> It’s convenient to use Silent Mode and Do Not Disturb to focus at work. Therefore, a simple reason why there’s no sound on your iPhone could be that these features are still turned on.</p><p>Here’s how to turn off Silent Mode:</p><ol><li>Find the<strong>Ring&#x2F;Silent</strong> switch, located on the top-left side of your iPhone.</li><li>If Silent Mode is on, an orange strip shows.</li><li>Move the switch towards the screen to cover the orange strip. This turns off Silent Mode.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/silent-switch-iphone.jpg"                      alt="ring and silent switch on side of iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcplMvRBulA?si=iBonbwDS1v7RAlHK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Here’s how to turn off Do Not Disturb or Focus:</p><ol><li>Access your iPhone’s<strong>Control Center</strong> .

Therefore, your iPhone’s sound is actually playing from those instead of the speakers.</p><p> You can disconnect the devices easily by turning off your iPhone’s Bluetooth:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Control Center</strong> .</li><li>The<strong>Bluetooth</strong> button is blue when switched on.

Check Your iPhone’s Sound Settings"></a>5. Check Your iPhone’s Sound Settings</h2><p> If your iPhone isn’t on Silent Mode or connected to any Bluetooth device, the problem of the sound not working may lie in your sound settings. First, adjust your volume buttons. You may think that there’s no sound on your iPhone because you accidentally turned the volume too low. To correct this, simply press the<strong>Volume Up</strong> button on the side of your iPhone.</p><p> If you already have your device’s volume turned up, but still find that your iPhone sound is not working—for example, incoming texts have no alert sounds—here’s how to check your other sound settings:</p><ol><li>In the<strong>Settings</strong> app, select<strong>Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong> .</li><li>Scroll to the<strong>Sounds</strong> <strong>and Vibration Patterns</strong> section.</li><li>Tap into each tone setting to check that there’s an alert tone selected. For example, tap<strong>Text Tone</strong> .</li><li>Make sure that<strong>None</strong> is not selected for anything.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-settings.jpg"                      alt="iphone settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sounds-haptics-iphone.jpg"                      alt="sounds and haptics on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4R7_qNIQvY?si=2zJOPfEcm6_3udzn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/text-tone-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="text tone on iphone settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If the sound issue revolves around iPhone alerts, you can refer to our detailed guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-iphone-not-receiving-alerts/" >how to fix alert sounds on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="6-Check-Third-Party-App-Sound-Settings"><a href="#6-Check-Third-Party-App-Sound-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6. Check Third-Party App Sound Settings"></a>6. Check Third-Party App Sound Settings</h2><p> If there’s no sound on your iPhone when you’re using a specific app, you should check the sound settings within the app itself. For messaging apps like WhatsApp, check that you chose a notification sound and that<strong>None</strong> is not selected. For games, make sure that you didn’t mute the audio or turn off some of the music settings.</p><p> You’ll need to root around in the relevant in-app settings to find these options as they move around for every app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sky-game-audio.jpg"                      alt="audio settings in sky game"                ></p><h2 id="7-Exit-and-Relaunch-the-Third-Party-App"><a href="#7-Exit-and-Relaunch-the-Third-Party-App" class="headerlink" title="7.

Exit and Relaunch the Third-Party App</h2><p> If you’ve already gone through all the sound settings and they’re all switched on correctly, your iPhone’s sound not working may just be an app glitch.</p><p> For instance, you may notice that an Instagram video has no sound, despite showing the audio icon. Even if you pressed your<strong>Volume Up</strong> button, the volume bar doesn’t appear either. On social media platforms like this, you can save the post, exit the app, open it again, and go to your<strong>Saved</strong> collection to enjoy the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/instagram-post.jpg"                      alt="person holding iphone showing instagram post"                ></p><p> You can also opt to view the video through another route.

For one, you might not have coverage at your current location. Either your carrier doesn’t offer cell service at your coordinates, or you’re blocked by a structure that the signal can’t penetrate.</p><p> If neither of those is the culprit, there are several troubleshooting steps you can try to fix this problem. So, let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="1-Turn-Cellular-Data-Off-and-On"><a href="#1-Turn-Cellular-Data-Off-and-On" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Cellular Data Off and On"></a>1.

That way, if you’re listening to music on your Mac but want to watch a video on your iPhone, you can just play that video, and your AirPods will automatically switch over to your iPhone.</p><p> Of course, that can also be annoying sometimes.

However, it can become annoying if you use too many Apple devices at once.</p><p> Fortunately, you can easily keep your AirPods from switching devices. But before we start, make sure you have your AirPods with you. You’ll need to connect them to your iPhone in order to change their settings.

Although it’s a handy feature, it doesn’t always work, and if you have an old device, it might not work at all.</p><p> So, if you’re having trouble using the Visual Look Up feature on your iPhone, here are some reasons why it might not be working and what you can do to fix it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="iPhone-Models-Supporting-Visual-Look-Up"><a href="#iPhone-Models-Supporting-Visual-Look-Up" class="headerlink" title="iPhone Models Supporting Visual Look Up"></a>iPhone Models Supporting Visual Look Up</h2><p> First off, be sure to check if your device is running iOS 15 or iPadOS 15.1 (and later). To check, head to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; About</strong> , then check the iOS or iPadOS version. To download and install the latest firmware available, go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> .</p><p> If your device’s software is up to date and Visual Look Up still isn’t working, it may be because your device doesn’t support the feature. Visual Look Up only works on devices with the A12 Bionic chip or later, meaning only the following models support Visual Look Up:</p><ul><li>iPad mini, 5th generation, and later</li><li>iPad, 8th generation, and later</li><li>iPad Air, 3rd generation and later</li><li>iPad Pro 11-inch, all generations</li><li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch, 3rd generation and later</li><li>iPhone SE (2020 and 2022 models)</li><li>iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR</li><li>iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max</li><li>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max</li><li>iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max</li><li>iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max</li></ul><p> If you have a compatible device but Visual Look Up is still not working, here are some possible reasons and workarounds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6Wfzj6YNDM?si=WRZQD9zCdQ1_tW1b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-You’re-Using-an-Unsupported-Language"><a href="#1-You’re-Using-an-Unsupported-Language" class="headerlink" title="1.

To enable this, here’s what you need to do:</p><ol><li>Head to<strong>Settings</strong> , then scroll down to<strong>Siri &amp; Search</strong> .</li><li>Under<strong>Content From Apple</strong> , toggle the switch on for<strong>Show in Look Up</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Siri--Search-Under-Settings.jpg"                      alt="Siri &amp; Search Under Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Show-in-Look-Up-in-Siri--Search.jpg"                      alt="Show in Look Up, in Siri &amp; Search"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-There-Is-a-Problem-With-the-Image"><a href="#3-There-Is-a-Problem-With-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="3. There Is a Problem With the Image"></a>3. There Is a Problem With the Image</h2><p> Visual Look Up doesn’t work well when there are too many objects in the picture, but it usually works fine when only a single object is in the photo. Hence, when you take a photo, try to ensure it’s centered and focusing on a single object.</p><p> Although Visual Look Up requires an ideal image to function at its best, it’s still one of the powerful <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hidden-iphone-features-make-productive/" >hidden iOS features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Sometimes, you may be able to detect an object even with an obstructed view—as shown in the example below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Obscured-Image-Still-Showing-Visual-Look-Up-Icon.PNG"                      alt="Obscured Image Still Showing Visual Look Up Icon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Obscured-Image-Not-Showing-Visual-Look-Up-Icon.PNG"                      alt="Obscured Image Not Showing Visual Look Up Icon"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> In some cases, Visual Look Up may detect more than one object in the photo, causing an error in retrieving results. You can see this in the example below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Visual-Look-Up-Detecting-Two-Objects.PNG"                      alt="Visual Look Up Detecting Two Objects"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Visual-Look-Up-Showing-No-results-for-two-objects.PNG"                      alt="Visual Look Up Showing No results for two objects"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If you’ve taken a photo of the object on its own and your device still can’t detect the object, the quality of the image may be a culprit. Check for lighting issues and glare before taking a photo, as you can greatly improve the accuracy of Visual Look Up if you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-camera-settings/" >master how to take photos on an iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odDOPrPjRYY?si=7QHzdUkTPNkHJiVj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-You-Aren’t-Connected-to-the-Internet"><a href="#4-You-Aren’t-Connected-to-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="4.

You’ll know your issue is a lack of internet connection when your device shows a Visual Look Up icon, but you get a<strong>No Content Found</strong> displayed in the results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Visual-Look-Up-icon-Showing-for-an-Image.PNG"                      alt="Visual Look Up icon Showing for an Image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqBKCGAKHmA?si=OkoaI17nE5qNqTHj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Content-Not-Found-after-tapping-Visual-Look-Up-icon.PNG"                      alt="Content Not Found after tapping Visual Look Up icon"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-The-Object-Isn’t-Supported-Yet"><a href="#5-The-Object-Isn’t-Supported-Yet" class="headerlink" title="5.

The Object Isn’t Supported Yet</h2><p> Despite the constant updates the feature has received since its introduction alongside iOS 15, Visual Look Up is still largely dependent on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/machine-learning-algorithms/" >machine learning algorithms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It means that while the feature does get better over time, there’s a chance it won’t recognize the object you want to learn more about.</p><p> So, if you know that the item you’re trying to learn about is supported, ensure that you try a different image from the internet because—as mentioned earlier—the first image you chose could also pose an issue, not letting Visual Look Up work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5gTm5KxtQ0?si=onF1rBS2nEM5nLGg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-There-May-Be-a-Software-Glitch"><a href="#6-There-May-Be-a-Software-Glitch" class="headerlink" title="6.

So make sure to try out each of the suggested workarounds, as various reasons can prevent the Visual Look Up feature from working as intended.</p><p> Apple has continuously improved Visual Look Up since its introduction alongside iOS 15, so if your initial impressions weren’t great, it’s worth giving it a shot again, especially if you’re a power user who often uses the many unique features of an iPhone—like Live Text, for example.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-channel-visualization-selecting-the-ideal-size-and-placement-for-yt/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Channel Visualization Selecting the Ideal Size and Placement for YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-network-needs-for-natural-growth-in-youtube-numbers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Navigating Network Needs for Natural Growth in Youtube Numbers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-compilation-of-the-best-9-multi-platform-video-communication-devices-iosandroid/"><u>[New] In 2024, Compilation of The Best 9 Multi-Platform Video Communication Devices (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-fb-video-shape-study-overview/"><u>[Updated] FB Video Shape Study Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/boosting-safari-speed-top-4-fixes-for-a-faster-iphone-experience/"><u>Boosting Safari Speed: Top 4 Fixes for a Faster iPhone Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/bypass-common-issues-reviving-iphone-dictation-functionality-with-easy-fixes/"><u>Bypass Common Issues: Reviving iPhone Dictation Functionality with Easy Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Samsung Galaxy A15 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/deciphering-iphone-glitches-when-imessages-send-as-text-is-your-contact-blocked/"><u>Deciphering iPhone Glitches: When iMessages Send as Text, Is Your Contact Blocked?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/1723002539333-enhancing-pc-gaming-experience-addressing-the-dip-in-frames-per-second-for-forza-horizon-amoons/"><u>Enhancing PC Gaming Experience: Addressing the Dip in Frames per Second for Forza Horizon Amoons.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/high-performance-2800w-atx-psu-with-dual-12v-rails-suitable-for-intensive-ai-workloads-featuring-four-6a-power-connectors-perfect-for-quad-gpu-configuration23/"><u>High-Performance 2800W ATX PSU with Dual 12V Rails Suitable for Intensive AI Workloads: Featuring Four 6A Power Connectors Perfect for Quad GPU Configurations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-fuzzy-iphone-photography-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>How to Resolve Fuzzy iPhone Photography: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/iphone-bootloader-configuration-mastering-dfu-mode-tutorial/"><u>IPhone Bootloader Configuration: Mastering DFU Mode Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/one-dead-airpod-in-pair-heres-the-ultimate-guide-to-diagnosing-and-repairing/"><u>One Dead AirPod in Pair?

After all, we use our phones for almost everything. If the touch response isn’t working, using your phone can be difficult, and it might not be possible to use it at all. This can make it hard to keep up with friends, plan your day, and even do your job.</p><p> Is your iPhone screen not working? If so, we’ll walk you through why that is and what you can do to get it working again.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4q6gyaEojM?si=ImdFm6Zsr0azykqV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Is-Your-iPhone-Touchscreen-Not-Working"><a href="#Why-Is-Your-iPhone-Touchscreen-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Your iPhone Touchscreen Not Working?"></a>Why Is Your iPhone Touchscreen Not Working?</h2><p> There are several reasons your iPhone touchscreen could stop working. One of the most common reasons is physical damage. If your screen stopped working after it hit something, the damage is most likely physical.</p><p> Other common causes of iPhone touchscreen problems are water damage and excessive heat.</p><p> Damage from excessive heat is actually quite common. Those who use a car vent clip for their iPhones are likely to experience heat damage if they turn the heat on. Many might not realize that the vent is even on since they don’t feel it, but the iPhone could get damaged in the process.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-home-button-working-fix/" >Is Your iPhone Home Button Not Working? Quick Fixes to Try <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If your iPhone was exposed to salt water before it stopped working, then that was most likely the cause of the damage. Salt water is corrosive and, while your phone might have been fine right away, the damage could continue to progress for weeks after exposure.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epKTCSREjhI?si=Ez_hObK1FZrmEE7f" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-Your-Touchscreen-Broken-or-Your-LCD-Screen"><a href="#Is-Your-Touchscreen-Broken-or-Your-LCD-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Is Your Touchscreen Broken or Your LCD Screen?"></a>Is Your Touchscreen Broken or Your LCD Screen?</h2><p> The iPhone actually has two parts to its screen. The top part is the digitizer and the part underneath is the LCD screen. The digitizer is the touchscreen and the LCD screen displays the contents of your iPhone.</p><p> When your digitizer isn’t working, your iPhone touch response won’t work properly. Meaning you’ll see your screen, but you won’t be able to interact with it correctly. Sometimes, only part of your screen will work, or it will take extra pressure to tap something.</p><p> If your LCD screen is out, your iPhone won’t turn on at all and you won’t see anything on your screen. Alternatively, your screen will be blurry or fuzzy or will have some sort of visible damage.</p><p> If there’s a problem with your digitizer, there are a few fixes you can try before taking your iPhone to a repair shop. However, if it’s the LCD, you’ll need to start searching for repairs straight away.</p><h2 id="Make-Sure-Touch-Accommodations-Is-Off"><a href="#Make-Sure-Touch-Accommodations-Is-Off" class="headerlink" title="Make Sure Touch Accommodations Is Off"></a>Make Sure Touch Accommodations Is Off</h2><p> Some users might have activated certain accessibility settings that can interfere with how the touchscreen works. The most common culprit is Touch Accommodations. If enabled, your iPhone screen will seem buggy and you’ll have a difficult time navigating the touchscreen.</p><p>If your screen is working, but not correctly, this could be the cause.</p><p> To check if this is enabled, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt;<strong>Touch</strong> &gt;<strong>Touch Accommodations</strong> and turn it off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iphone-touch-accommodations.jpg"                      alt="iphone touch accommodations"                ></p><p> If you’re having a hard time navigating there because of the dodgy touchscreen, just activate Siri and say “Turn off Touch Accommodations.”</p><p> Alternatively, you can click the Side button three times and this will disable it on most newer devices. For older devices, you may need to tap the Home button three times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJlICvacgJY?si=jNeijBVj7ia4ammA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Back-Up-and-Factory-Reset-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Back-Up-and-Factory-Reset-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Back Up and Factory Reset Your iPhone"></a>Back Up and Factory Reset Your iPhone</h2><p> If your touchscreen isn’t working correctly, you might have a software issue. While this is rare, it can happen.</p><p> If turning your iPhone off and on again doesn’t do anything, you’ll need to do a factory reset. Be sure to back up your iPhone before moving forward. If you can use your screen in some way, navigate to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>General</strong> &gt;<strong>Transfer or Reset iPhone</strong> &gt;<strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iphone-erase-content.jpg"                      alt="iphone erase content"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlwr9LjJ-ng?si=I6UNAtfBkY2FTceu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you can’t navigate here, you’ll need to plug your iPhone into a computer to perform a factory reset.

This ensures that the technician won’t be able to access your personal data. They may also need to test Face ID to make sure the repair worked and will need the phone to be unlocked to do so, which means you’re better off erasing all your data first.</p><h2 id="Getting-Your-iPhone-Screen-Repaired"><a href="#Getting-Your-iPhone-Screen-Repaired" class="headerlink" title="Getting Your iPhone Screen Repaired"></a>Getting Your iPhone Screen Repaired</h2><p> If the above fixes didn’t work, this means you almost certainly need a physical repair.</p><p> If your iPhone is under warranty, you’ll want to get Apple to take a look at it as soon as possible. Visit the <a class="link"   href="http://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service" >Apple website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to figure out if you have a warranty. If you have AppleCare+, your repair will be deeply discounted.</p><p> If you aren’t under warranty and don’t have AppleCare+, you can still use the above link to find authorized repair shops near you. Apple-recognized repair shops are the best place to go to get your device repaired. However, they can be expensive.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/applecare-what-are-your-options-is-it-really-worth-it/" >AppleCare+ Warranty: What Are Your Options and Is It Worth It? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If your phone is an older model or you’re on a budget, consider exploring other repair alternatives. Screen repair shops and kiosks are popular, and some of them do a great job for a fraction of the price. However, you might not get the best repair.</p><p> You can also attempt the repair yourself, but if you make a mistake you could do more damage. If you want to try it yourself, you can buy iPhone screens online and most of them include a DIY toolkit.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-gadgets-help-websites/" >Learn to Fix Your Own Gadgets With Help From These Sites <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Using-Your-iPhone-Without-a-Touchscreen"><a href="#Using-Your-iPhone-Without-a-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Using Your iPhone Without a Touchscreen"></a>Using Your iPhone Without a Touchscreen</h2><p> If your iPhone isn’t working but you need to access certain files, you can still do that. To do so, you’ll need to activate Voice Control. This can be helpful for backing up and restoring your iPhone.</p><p> To do this, your phone screen will need to at least partially work. If so, try to make your way to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt;<strong>Voice Control</strong> and turn that on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iphone-voice-control.jpg"                      alt="iphone voice control"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLO5dwmJAVs?si=1OYH8rv8aPaMsCiU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If Siri’s enabled, you can enable Voice Control by saying “Hey Siri, turn on Voice Control.” Once enabled, you can access your iPhone without using the touchscreen.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/places-that-fix-iphone-screens-for-cheap/" >Where to Fix iPhone Screens for Cheap: Places to Check Out <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To use Voice Control, you should familiarize yourself with the basic commands.<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/HT210417" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a full list of these commands on its website.</p><h2 id="iPhone-Screen-Not-Working-These-Fixes-Should-Have-Helped"><a href="#iPhone-Screen-Not-Working-These-Fixes-Should-Have-Helped" class="headerlink" title="iPhone Screen Not Working?

However, a user might have activated Touch Accommodations, which could be the culprit. There are also rare cases where a software problem can cause the touchscreen to work and a factory reset could solve the problem.</p><p> No matter what happened to your iPhone screen, it’s important to get your device functional again. After all, we use our phone for everything nowadays, and not being able to use it can change how we engage in daily life.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-perfect-pictures-at-work-master-snap-camera-use/"><u>[Updated] Perfect Pictures at Work Master Snap Camera Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-aural-artistry-the-intersection-of-sound-and-image-on-insta/"><u>2024 Approved Aural Artistry The Intersection of Sound and Image on Insta</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-daenerys-dialer-leading-online-picks-to-download-game-ringtones/"><u>2024 Approved Daenerys' Dialer Leading Online Picks to Download Game Ringtones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-help.techidaily.com/1728483160986-aomei-backupper/"><u>優點測試：不同版本間的AOMEI Backupper相異之處</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-tutorial-activating-ipad-recovery-mode-easily/"><u>A Comprehensive Tutorial: Activating iPad Recovery Mode Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/elite-cameras-for-windows-11-pro-review-of-the-latest-gear-for-2024/"><u>Elite Cameras for Windows 11 - Pro Review of the Latest Gear for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/essential-wakeup-solutions-ranking-the-best-alarm-clock-apps-available-today/"><u>Essential Wakeup Solutions: Ranking the Best Alarm Clock Apps Available Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/getting-siri-back-on-track-fix-these-common-iphoneipad-mishaps/"><u>Getting Siri Back on Track - Fix These Common iPhone/iPad Mishaps!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-poco-x5-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Poco X5 PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/navigating-iphone-troubleshooting-with-ease-using-the-apple-support-app/"><u>Navigating iPhone Troubleshooting with Ease Using the Apple Support App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/reactivate-and-reclaim-solutions-for-an-unreachable-find-my-iphone-service/"><u>Reactivate & Reclaim: Solutions for an Unreachable Find My iPhone Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/solution-guide-enabling-compatibility-for-non-supported-iphone-accessories/"><u>Solution Guide: Enabling Compatibility for Non-Supported iPhone Accessories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-our-top-6-preferred-platforms-for-streaming-music-videos-on-the-internet/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Our Top 6 Preferred Platforms for Streaming Music Videos on the Internet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/top-six-solutions-to-prevent-your-airpods-from-auto-switching-across-iphone-and-mac/"><u>Top Six Solutions to Prevent Your AirPods From Auto-Switching Across iPhone and Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/translate-videos-with-subtitle-cat-your-essential-guide/"><u>Translate Videos with Subtitle Cat Your Essential Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721471709385-whatsapp-and-icloud-syncing-problems-discover-effective-solutions-here/"><u>WhatsApp and iCloud Syncing Problems?

Also, clean the charging port, restart your iPhone, and update iOS.</li><li>It’s best to avoid overriding the “Liquid Detected” alert. If you need to charge your iPhone urgently, use a wireless charger instead.</li></ul><p> Attempting to charge your iPhone but see an alert telling you that liquid has been detected in the connector? Let’s look at the troubleshooting steps you can take to resolve the “Liquid Detected” alert and charge your iPhone normally again.</p><h2 id="1-Dry-the-USB-C-or-Lightning-Port"><a href="#1-Dry-the-USB-C-or-Lightning-Port" class="headerlink" title="1. Dry the USB-C or Lightning Port"></a>1. Dry the USB-C or Lightning Port</h2><p> Even if you’re holding a dry iPhone in your hands, it’s safer to assume that the “Liquid Detected” alert is accurate. Keep in mind that while iPhones are water-resistant, they are not waterproof. Additionally,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-iphones-are-waterproof/" >not all iPhone models are water-resistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Therefore, if you dropped your iPhone into the water or went swimming with it recently, it’s highly probable that water got into the charging port. The solution to this is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-drying-smartphone-usb-port/" >dry the charging port on your device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> In the future, if you do want to bring your iPhone to the pool or a water sports event, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-iphone-14-pro-max-waterproof-cases/" >consider purchasing a waterproof iPhone case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that encloses your device entirely. Otherwise, you shouldn’t shower or swim with your iPhone, as <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108039" >Apple warns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> On the other hand, if you’re sure that your iPhone has been nowhere near water for the past several weeks, the “Liquid Detected” alert might simply be a glitch. In that case, let’s move on to the other solutions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vca--yEhtdo?si=7ijqjyP-oi3LYze1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Troubleshoot-the-Charging-Cable"><a href="#2-Troubleshoot-the-Charging-Cable" class="headerlink" title="2.

If the alert only pops up when you use a particular cable, you know the issue is with the cable, not your iPhone.</p><p> There are lots of cheap, counterfeit Apple cables out there. It’s always best to purchase official or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-mfi-certified-explained/" >MFi-certified accessories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to prevent compatibility issues and damage they might cause to your iPhone.</p><h2 id="3-Clean-Your-iPhone’s-Charging-Port"><a href="#3-Clean-Your-iPhone’s-Charging-Port" class="headerlink" title="3. Clean Your iPhone’s Charging Port"></a>3. Clean Your iPhone’s Charging Port</h2><p> If debris is stuck in your iPhone’s Lightning or USB-C port, it may also cause charging issues. You can use the SIM-eject tool to gently <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/" >clean your iPhone’s charging port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and see if this resolves the “Liquid Detected” message.</p><p> You should not spray cleaning agents directly onto your device or use compressed air when cleaning your iPhone.</p><h2 id="4-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your iPhone"></a>4. Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> The next troubleshooting step is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-soft-reset/" >soft reset your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , also known as a force restart. Restarting is an effective solution for nearly all minor technical problems for any device, so it’s definitely worth a try to get rid of the “Liquid Detected” alert.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=lhdUUVYMVQjzHXBh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Update-Your-iPhone"><a href="#5-Update-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="5.

Update Your iPhone</h2><p> Lastly, it’s best to update your iPhone to the latest iOS version if you haven’t done that already. iOS updates carry bug fixes and performance improvements, which may help remove unnecessary warnings such as this one from popping up.</p><p> Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> on your iPhone to check if an iOS update is available.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAkb8Bv3AU4?si=2rHwnZYTzTLieKgY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Use-Emergency-Override-to-Charge-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Should-You-Use-Emergency-Override-to-Charge-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Should You Use Emergency Override to Charge Your iPhone?"></a>Should You Use Emergency Override to Charge Your iPhone?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iphone-showing-charging-not-available-error.jpg"                      alt="iPhone showing Charging Not Available error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKFdFHaVIJg?si=x2vLw7ty3FtHX-9T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/mockups/mockup/b808ea7dedf" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and CK Foto&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/water-splash-isolated-on-white-backgroundwater-2334703683" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The “Liquid Detected” alert may provide an<strong>Emergency Override</strong> option to charge your iPhone, but is it safe to do so?</p><p> If you’re aware that your iPhone is still wet, you should not attempt to charge it with a wired charger, as it may permanently damage your device. A safer alternative is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-charge-iphone/" >charge your iPhone wirelessly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but dry the back of your iPhone before doing so.</p><p> Remember that the “Liquid Detected in USB-C (or Lightning) Connector” alert protects your device from permanent damage and ensures your safety. It’s certainly a hazard if an iPhone were to continue charging despite a wet Lightning port.</p><p> Still, the alert may sometimes pop up even if your iPhone isn’t wet. But by following the steps above, you should be able to resolve the error quickly and charge your iPhone again. If the problem persists, it’s best to contact Apple Support to see if there are other issues with your device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-effortlessly-blend-your-yt-video-with-gs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Effortlessly Blend Your YT Video with GS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-earnings-engineering-crafting-a-high-yield-strategy-for-your-youtube-channel/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Earnings Engineering Crafting a High Yield Strategy for Your YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-images-a-professionals-palette-playbook-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Images A Professional's Palette Playbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-unlinking-from-youtube-shorts-easy-and-permanent-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlinking From YouTube Shorts - Easy and Permanent for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/3-effective-troubleshooting-tips-for-when-your-iphone-contact-list-isnt-responding/"><u>3 Effective Troubleshooting Tips for When Your iPhone Contact List Isn't Responding</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/6-effective-fixes-for-an-iphone-stuck-showing-sos-in-the-status-bar-restore-full-use/"><u>6 Effective Fixes for an iPhone Stuck Showing SOS in the Status Bar - Restore Full Use!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-dji-inspire-1-unveiled/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis DJI Inspire 1 Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-your-iphones-malfunctioning-voicemail-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>How to Repair Your iPhone's Malfunctioning Voicemail – A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-easy-to-use-frp-bypass-tools-for-unlocking-google-accounts-on-honor-magic-6-lite-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 10 Easy-to-Use FRP Bypass Tools for Unlocking Google Accounts On Honor Magic 6 Lite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-top-5-android-apps-that-use-fingerprint-sensor-to-lock-your-apps-on-honor-magic-v2-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Top 5 Android Apps That Use Fingerprint Sensor to Lock Your Apps On Honor Magic V2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/shadowplay-not-working-expert-tips-to-get-your-game-recordings-up-and-running-in-windows/"><u>Shadowplay Not Working?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Understanding-iMessage-Conversion-to-SMS-Is-This-a-Sign-of-Being-Blocked"><a href="#Understanding-iMessage-Conversion-to-SMS-Is-This-a-Sign-of-Being-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Understanding iMessage Conversion to SMS: Is This a Sign of Being Blocked?"></a>Understanding iMessage Conversion to SMS: Is This a Sign of Being Blocked?</h2><p> iMessages are texts and media sent between Apple devices over an internet connection. A successfully sent iMessage appears as a blue text bubble in your chat conversation.</p><p> However, you’re probably here because you noticed your messages are sent as a green text bubble instead of blue or perhaps saw a “Sent as Text Message” note at the bottom of the bubble.</p><p> What does this mean? Have you been blocked? Below, we explain why you’re probably not blocked, why your iMessage is sent as a text message, and how to actually test whether you’re blocked or not.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="iMessage-Sent-as-Text-Message-Does-This-Mean-You’re-Blocked"><a href="#iMessage-Sent-as-Text-Message-Does-This-Mean-You’re-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="iMessage Sent as Text Message: Does This Mean You’re Blocked?"></a>iMessage Sent as Text Message: Does This Mean You’re Blocked?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-1.jpg"                      alt="person wearing grey hoodie with hands holding iphone"                ></p><p> The truth is that you can’t tell if a person has blocked you based on the fact that your iMessage was sent as a text message alone. Regardless of whether you were blocked or not, you’ll still hear the sound of the green bubble text being successfully sent as usual. The message doesn’t bounce back. You can continue to send messages to the recipient.</p><p> Therefore, an iMessage sent as a text message on your iPhone does not immediately indicate that your number is blocked by the recipient. There are other reasons why your messages show up as green bubbles when you send them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=heERQcpMi77lqToE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Reasons-Why-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message"><a href="#4-Reasons-Why-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message" class="headerlink" title="4 Reasons Why Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message"></a>4 Reasons Why Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-2.jpg"                      alt="man sending text message on iphone"                ></p><p> When your iMessage is sent as a text message, it’s worth checking whether the root cause of the issue lies with your iPhone first.</p><p> iMessage texts sending in green instead of blue is a common problem when the service stops functioning as it should, so apply various <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/imessage-not-working-on-mac-iphone-ipad/" >troubleshooting methods to fix iMessage on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first.</p><p> But if you have gone through the fixes and your device appears to have no issues, the problem is likely on the recipient’s end. However, it doesn’t mean you’re blocked either. There are a few simple reasons why your iMessage is sent as a text message to them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpdGEJJwMLY?si=eKgXOPpNeYvYKcel" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-The-Recipient’s-Device-Is-Not-Connected-to-the-Internet"><a href="#1-The-Recipient’s-Device-Is-Not-Connected-to-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="1. The Recipient’s Device Is Not Connected to the Internet"></a>1. The Recipient’s Device Is Not Connected to the Internet</h3><p> For a text to be successfully sent as an iMessage, the recipient’s Apple device must also be connected to the internet. Otherwise, the iMessage will be sent as a text message to their device, or you might see an <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-imessage-not-delivered/" >“iMessage Not Delivered” error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your iPhone if it’s not sent out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15Ju8Cb4UZ8?si=5wdiQXdz1BOxIkDH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-The-Recipient-Wasn’t-Using-an-Apple-Device-at-the-Time"><a href="#2-The-Recipient-Wasn’t-Using-an-Apple-Device-at-the-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. The Recipient Wasn’t Using an Apple Device at the Time"></a>2. The Recipient Wasn’t Using an Apple Device at the Time</h3><p> Remember, iMessage only works between Apple devices. So, if your family or friend switches from an iPhone to an Android smartphone, for example, your iMessage will automatically be sent as a text message to them.</p><p> Your iPhone does not notify you that they have changed devices, even if your previous chat conversations were held using iMessage.</p><h3 id="3-The-Recipient’s-Device-Was-Turned-Off"><a href="#3-The-Recipient’s-Device-Was-Turned-Off" class="headerlink" title="3.

When this happens, you can still continue to message them. However, your iMessage will be sent as a text message or simply remain pending until the other party turns on their device again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7AYCS7zBU0?si=7R9oIpE4hyEbtk3x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Recipient-Disabled-iMessage-on-Their-iPhone"><a href="#4-The-Recipient-Disabled-iMessage-on-Their-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Recipient Disabled iMessage on Their iPhone</h3><p> iMessage is a feature that can be enabled and disabled in the iPhone’s Settings app. For whatever reason, your contact may have chosen to turn off iMessage.</p><p> If this happens, you’ll be unable to send and receive iMessages from them. However, both of you can still reach each other with SMS text messages.</p><h2 id="How-to-Test-if-Someone-Blocked-You-From-Contacting-Them"><a href="#How-to-Test-if-Someone-Blocked-You-From-Contacting-Them" class="headerlink" title="How to Test if Someone Blocked You From Contacting Them"></a>How to Test if Someone Blocked You From Contacting Them</h2><p> There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/find-out-if-someone-blocked-your-phone-number/" >ways to check if someone has blocked your phone number <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In this case, the most effective method is to simply call your target recipient. An iPhone user can’t choose to block you on iMessage without blocking you entirely. Therefore, if the call goes through, it confirms that you’re not blocked.</p><p> If the call doesn’t go through, you shouldn’t immediately start panicking either. There are a variety of reasons why you’re <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-iphone-cant-make-calls/" >unable to make phone calls on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Poor call signal in an area is one of the biggest culprits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3-1.jpg"                      alt="woman making a call on iphone with white case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFHH14XlFCk?si=2HcjQbDx5eG0ZQAt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Therefore, you can also reach out to your recipient via third-party apps such as WhatsApp or Messenger. If you’re still connected on those platforms, it’s unlikely that the person had any intention to cut you off, and the issues of being unable to call them or send them an iMessage were likely minor technical hiccups.</p><h2 id="Don’t-Panic-When-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message"><a href="#Don’t-Panic-When-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Panic When Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message"></a>Don’t Panic When Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message</h2><p> Due to its dependence on an internet connection, it’s common for an iMessage to fail and be sent as a text message when connectivity issues crop up.</p><p> If you’ve been worried that you were blocked because your iMessage was sent as a text message, we hope our explanation has helped reassure you that it’s a very unlikely case.</p><p> Therefore, don’t panic or jump to conclusions quickly. Reach out using other methods if you need to contact your recipient urgently.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-retrospective-facebook-viewing-techniques-for-laptops-and-phones/"><u>[New] In 2024, Retrospective Facebook Viewing Techniques for Laptops and Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-transforming-virtual-worlds-enhancing-spark-ar-with-custom-luts-for-2024/"><u>[New] Transforming Virtual Worlds Enhancing Spark AR with Custom LUTs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-ocam-screen-recorder-review-and-alternative-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] OCam Screen Recorder Review and Alternative for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-selecting-screen-recorder-software/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Selecting Screen Recorder Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/elevate-your-webcam-experience-windows-7-driver-downloads-instantly/"><u>Elevate Your Webcam Experience: Windows 7 Driver Downloads Instantly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/error-4013-on-iphone-heres-how-to-correctly-update-or-restore-your-device/"><u>Error 4013 on iPhone?
