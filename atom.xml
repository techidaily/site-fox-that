However, some settings could lower that number, and you could have enabled them without knowing. So, read on to discover how to fix this issue.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Adjust-the-Camera’s-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Adjust-the-Camera’s-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the Camera’s Aspect Ratio"></a>Adjust the Camera’s Aspect Ratio</h2><p> If you know <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/aspect-ratios-in-photography-guide/" >what aspect ratio is in photography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you most likely don’t need this guide. Simply put, the aspect ratio is essentially the ratio of the width to the height of an image.</p><p> The default aspect ratio on the iPhone is 4:3 since the camera sensor is 4:3. If you’ve set the aspect ratio to anything else, your iPhone will use only part of its sensor, which leads to lower details and, therefore, lower megapixels. So, here’s how to change your iPhone camera’s aspect ratio:</p><ol><li>Open the built-in Camera app on your iPhone, and make sure your phone is in<strong>Photo</strong> mode.</li><li>Swipe up in Photo mode to reveal the camera options.</li><li>Tap where it says<strong>16:9</strong> or<strong>1:1</strong> . Then, select<strong>4:3</strong> from the available options.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-camera-app-in-photo-mode.jpeg"                      alt="iPhone Camera app in Photo mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-mode-options-in-the-camera-app.jpeg"                      alt="Photo mode options in the Camera app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR4gsW-J7as?si=9a56UDKZKhREZnwz&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/aspect-ratio-options-in-the-camera-app-for-iphone.jpeg"                      alt="Aspect ratio options in the Camera app for iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8U3ooyFiAB4?si=yXPQrDhMBEJwN2EZ&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-aspect-ratio.jpeg"                      alt="iPhone camera in 4-3 aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If your aspect ratio returns to 16:9 or 1:1 upon relaunching the Camera app, you can fix it in<strong>Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Preserve Settings</strong> .

It turns out this isn’t a bug, it’s a feature: Dynamic Head Tracking. And you can turn it off in the Control Center.</p><p> Below, we’ll explain what Dynamic Head Tracking is and how to customize it for each app on your iPhone.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Dynamic-Head-Tracking"><a href="#What-Is-Dynamic-Head-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="What Is Dynamic Head Tracking?"></a>What Is Dynamic Head Tracking?</h2><p> Apple introduced Dynamic Head Tracking alongside <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-spatial-audio/" >Spatial Audio on the iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create a more immersive audio experience. Essentially, it uses sensors in your AirPods to track your head movement, then adjusts the audio so it always sounds like it’s coming from the direction of your iPhone.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/spatial-audio-vs-spatialize-stereo/" >Spatial Audio vs. Spatialize Stereo: Is There a Difference? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Dynamic Head Tracking is also available when you’re using your AirPods with an iPad, Mac, or Apple TV 4K.</p><p> This is great when you’re watching a movie: whenever you turn your head, the audio still sounds as though it’s coming from your screen, rather than moving with your head. But it’s not so great if you’re listening to a podcast with your phone in your pocket, when you always want the audio to be centered regardless of which direction you turn your head.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pejPLJBLmXw?si=WD97jA3doqbMCkCX&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-I-Turn-Off-Dynamic-Head-Tracking"><a href="#How-Do-I-Turn-Off-Dynamic-Head-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Turn Off Dynamic Head Tracking?"></a>How Do I Turn Off Dynamic Head Tracking?</h2><p> To disable Dynamic Head Tracking completely, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; AirPods</strong> and disable the<strong>Follow iPhone</strong> option.</p><p> This is quick, but it’s overkill if you still want to benefit from head tracking while watching videos or using certain apps. Instead, it’s better to edit your Dynamic Head Tracking settings on an app-by-app basis, which you can do from the Control Center:</p><ol><li>Use your AirPods to listen to audio from the app you want to edit.</li><li>Swipe down from the top-right corner to open<strong>Control Center</strong> . If your iPhone has a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen instead.</li><li>Tap and hold on the<strong>AirPods Volume</strong> slider to reveal more options.</li><li>Tap the<strong>Spatial Audio</strong> (or<strong>Spatialize Stereo</strong>) button in the bottom-right corner and choose<strong>Fixed</strong> or<strong>Off</strong> from the following three options:  <ul><li><strong>Off:</strong> Disables Dynamic Head Tracking and Spatial Audio (or Spatialize Stereo)  </li><li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Disables Dynamic Head Tracking while enabling Spatial Audio (or Spatialize Stereo)  </li><li><strong>Head Tracked:</strong> Enables Dynamic Head Tracking and Spatial Audio (or Spatialize Stereo).</li></ul></li><li>Repeat these steps for any other apps you want to fix the audio for.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Control-Center-showing-AirPods-Volums.jpg"                      alt="Control Center showing AirPods Volums"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3VlwHTQQMs?si=BXYwD1pKiaTuev4y&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AirPods-Volume-slider-showing-Spatial-Audio-button.jpg"                      alt="AirPods Volume slider showing Spatial Audio button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=M69YSY0Mk_gsdU0Q&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AirPods-Spatial-Audio-options-in-Control-Center.jpg"                      alt="AirPods Spatial Audio options in Control Center"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yZKNLxj3po?si=-RbF6nCJEVlHWP-M&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkdZ3A1mock?si=2zeR5GtTU2VujM_w&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Some-Sounds-Are-Best-Fixed-in-Place"><a href="#Some-Sounds-Are-Best-Fixed-in-Place" class="headerlink" title="Some Sounds Are Best Fixed in Place"></a>Some Sounds Are Best Fixed in Place</h2><p> Dynamic Head Tracking is a cool feature and it works well for movies and videos, but it’s usually little more than a distraction when you’re listening to music, audiobooks, or podcasts. That’s especially true if you aren’t looking at your iPhone while listening to audio.</p><p> Use this guide to customize Dynamic Head Tracking so it’s there when you want it, and not when you don’t.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-facebooks-videography-preference-which-orientation-for-2024/"><u>[New] Facebook's Videography Preference Which Orientation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-pro-level-insights-for-perfectly-crafted-snaps/"><u>[New] Pro-Level Insights for Perfectly Crafted Snaps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-slide-by-slide-audio-integration-for-dynamic-ppts/"><u>[New] Slide-by-Slide Audio Integration for Dynamic PPTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-add-videos-in-instagram-story/"><u>[Updated] How to Add Videos in Instagram Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-within.techidaily.com/django-boosted-with-bootstrap-4-the-ultimate-black-admin-by-creative-tim/"><u>Django Boosted with Bootstrap 4 - The Ultimate Black Admin by Creative Tim</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/effective-methods-to-resolve-an-icy-iphone-screen-issue/"><u>Effective Methods to Resolve an Icy iPhone Screen Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/gifting-on-mobile-5-common-issues-faced-by-iphoneipad-users/"><u>Gifting on Mobile: 5 Common Issues Faced by iPhone/iPad Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-bypass-tecno-pova-6-pro-5g-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Full Guide to Bypass Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/latest-guide-on-ipad-23-and-apple-iphone-15-pro-icloud-activation-lock-bypass-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/leveraging-vector-databases-in-artificinas-intelligence/"><u>Leveraging Vector Databases in Artificinas Intelligence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/navigating-through-error-4013-on-your-iphone-strategies-for-successful-restoration/"><u>Navigating Through Error 4013 on Your iPhone: Strategies for Successful Restoration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/solve-common-iphone-glitches-by-restoring-network-configuration/"><u>Solve Common iPhone Glitches by Restoring Network Configuration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-an-iphone-silent-mode-that-wont-turn-on-effective-solutions/"><u>Troubleshooting an iPhone Silent Mode That Won't Turn On: Effective Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/ultimate-pick-the-best-video-restoration-tools-for-windows-and-mac-enthusiasts/"><u>Ultimate Pick: The Best Video Restoration Tools for Windows & Mac Enthusiasts</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But unlike a Mac or other laptops, it doesn’t have a heat sink or a fan to regulate the temperature and keep everything cool. When you put it under stress, it will generate heat.</p><p> But there’s a difference between a device that’s warm to touch and one that’s overheating. We’ll find out the reasons and discuss why your iPhone gets hot, along with how to diagnose and fix the problem.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkdZ3A1mock?si=2zeR5GtTU2VujM_w&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-Gets-Hot"><a href="#Why-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-Gets-Hot" class="headerlink" title="Why Your iPhone or iPad Gets Hot"></a>Why Your iPhone or iPad Gets Hot</h2><p> When you use your devices for any length of time, it’ll get warm. That’s perfectly normal and shouldn’t concern you. However, there are some activities that, when carried out for an extended period, may cause your iPhone or iPad to overheat. They include:</p><ul><li>Charging and using your device at the same time.</li><li>Streaming a high-quality video.</li><li>Using GPS and real-time navigation controls.</li><li>Setting up your device for the first time or restoring it from a backup.</li><li>Using graphically demanding or processor-intensive apps.</li><li>Leaving the device in a car on a hot day or exposing it to direct sunlight.</li></ul><p> When your iPhone or iPad is overheating, you’ll also likely experience other issues such as:</p><ul><li>Display dimming or going black intermittently.</li><li>Poor call quality.</li><li>Unusable camera flash.</li><li>Graphic-intensive apps stop working properly or, worse, crash on launch.</li><li>Temperature warning messages stating “iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it” or “Charging On Hold.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/muo-in-article-image-1200px-by-600px-21-ratio-34.jpg"                      alt="iphone message saying charging on hold"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3PFn06LijE?si=zHrmlTOzrKxXe-k4&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Solutions-When-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-Is-Overheating"><a href="#Solutions-When-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-Is-Overheating" class="headerlink" title="Solutions When Your iPhone or iPad Is Overheating"></a>Solutions When Your iPhone or iPad Is Overheating</h2><p> First, it’s important to point out that no method can magically cool down an overheating iPhone or iPad immediately.</p><p> The suggested fixes below are mostly about adjusting how you use and care for your device, as well as tweaking some settings to prevent your device from overheating quickly during everyday use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DJKH1uY7P0?si=tCG66XVlbwSKoATj&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Pause-Device-Usage-for-the-Heat-to-Dissipate"><a href="#1-Pause-Device-Usage-for-the-Heat-to-Dissipate" class="headerlink" title="1. Pause Device Usage for the Heat to Dissipate"></a>1. Pause Device Usage for the Heat to Dissipate</h3><p> The first step is to temporarily stop using your iPhone or iPad so that your device can cool off properly. So, exit the app you’re using, press the<strong>Sleep&#x2F;Wake</strong> (or<strong>Side</strong>) button to put your iPhone or iPad to sleep, and leave it alone for 10 to 15 minutes to cool down completely.</p><p> To help speed up the process, you can also remove your iPhone or iPad case and turn off the device altogether.</p><p> To quickly reduce overheating, some people try putting their iPhones in the fridge or directly in front of an air conditioner. You should never do this because sudden changes in the temperature can cause condensation and damage your iPhone’s internal components.</p><h3 id="2-Don’t-Charge-and-Use-Your-Device-at-the-Same-Time"><a href="#2-Don’t-Charge-and-Use-Your-Device-at-the-Same-Time" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, charging your iPhone or iPad while using the device simultaneously will cause it to overheat quickly, especially if you’re playing a graphic-intensive game or using it for activities like video calls.</p><p> Unless it’s an emergency, leave your iPhone or iPad to cool down, as mentioned earlier, and plug in only to charge your device afterward.

However, when you’re going somewhere without it, make sure you’re not accidentally leaving your device in a place that’s exposed to direct sunlight (like a desk next to the window) or in a car.</p><p> In the latter case, temperatures in parked cars can exceed the optimum temperature range and thus cause your iPhone or iPad to overheat. Remember to keep your iPhone or iPad in a shaded area so that they do not get hot due to external environmental factors.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Official-or-MFi-Certified-Chargers-for-Your-iPhone-and-iPad"><a href="#4-Use-Official-or-MFi-Certified-Chargers-for-Your-iPhone-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="4.

Go to<strong>Settings &gt; Battery</strong> to examine the battery usage of your apps for the<strong>Last 24 Hours</strong> and<strong>Last 10 days</strong> . Tap<strong>Show Activity</strong> for both the onscreen and background battery usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-main-settings.JPEG"                      alt="iphone main settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-battery-usage.JPEG"                      alt="iphone battery usage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-battery-usage-by-activity.JPEG"                      alt="iphone battery usage by activity"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Then, go back to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh</strong> .

Reduce Screen Brightness"></a>6. Reduce Screen Brightness</h3><p> If your screen brightness is above 50% or more, your iPhone or iPad will tend to stay warm at all times and will be more prone to overheating. Therefore, decreasing the brightness can help prevent your iPhone or iPad from getting hot quickly.</p><p> On an iPhone (or iPad) with Face ID, swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the<strong>Control Center</strong> . If you have an iPhone with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen instead. Then, drag the brightness slider downwards as you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-control-center-showing-high-screen-brightness.JPEG"                      alt="iphone control center showing high screen brightness"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-control-center-showing-lowered-screen-brightness.JPEG"                      alt="iphone control center showing lowered screen brightness"                ></p><p>Close</p><h3 id="7-Update-Your-Device-and-Its-Apps"><a href="#7-Update-Your-Device-and-Its-Apps" class="headerlink" title="7.

Update Your Device and Its Apps</h3><p> Updates often carry bug fixes and performance improvements that can help resolve the issue when your iPhone or iPad keeps getting hot. Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> to check if an iOS update is available. The same applies to third-party apps. It’s best to head to the App Store to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-manually-or-automatically-update-apps-iphone/" >update your iPhone apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> For example, many iPhone 15 and 15 Pro users initially found that their newly bought devices kept overheating. Apple identified that the cause was a bug in iOS 17 and quickly rolled out an iOS software update in response. In this case, make sure to update your iPhone to at least iOS 17.0.3 to prevent it from overheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_7670.JPEG"                      alt="iphone ios 17.0.3 software update"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone-ios-up-to-date.JPEG"                      alt="iphone ios up to date"                ></p><p>Close</p><h3 id="8-Uninstall-and-Reinstall-Problematic-Apps"><a href="#8-Uninstall-and-Reinstall-Problematic-Apps" class="headerlink" title="8.

You might need to uninstall and reinstall it again on your iPhone or iPad.</p><p> To uninstall an app, go to your<strong>Home Screen</strong> , long-tap it, and choose<strong>Remove App</strong> . Then, tap<strong>Delete App</strong> when you get a confirmation pop-up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/app-options-on-iphone-home-screen.JPEG"                      alt="app options on iphone home screen"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/remove-app-confirmation-in-iphone.JPEG"                      alt="remove app confirmation in iphone"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> After uninstallation, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restore-deleted-app-iphone/" >reinstall the app on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or iPad.

This returns all settings on your iPhone or iPad to its default state. No data will be deleted, so you don’t need to worry about losing your photos, videos, or messages.</p><p> To reset your device, go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset &gt; Reset All Settings</strong> . The resetting process can take a while, so it’s best to attempt this when you don’t need to use your iPhone or iPad urgently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7383.JPEG"                      alt="iphone general settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7384.JPEG"                      alt="transfer or reset iphone settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dOfcihxjiw?si=_fkp1S1Uw0N1dp6b&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7385.JPEG"                      alt="transfer or reset iphone settings confirmation window"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vfq0vw0Spz8?si=2EAk6hW-Gb-o33_L&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Prevent-Your-iPhone-and-iPad-From-Getting-Hot"><a href="#Prevent-Your-iPhone-and-iPad-From-Getting-Hot" class="headerlink" title="Prevent Your iPhone and iPad From Getting Hot"></a>Prevent Your iPhone and iPad From Getting Hot</h2><p> Your iPhone or iPad will feel warm to the touch after prolonged use, which is normal.

While it’s usually fast, sometimes Safari can be slow or laggy. When this happens, it can be bothersome, and some might even download another third-party browser.</p><p> If you’re noticing that Safari is running slow on your iPhone, there are several things you can do to speed it up again. Give these tips a try, and hopefully, Safari will be at full speed in no time.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Check-Your-Internet-Speed"><a href="#Check-Your-Internet-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Check Your Internet Speed"></a>Check Your Internet Speed</h2><p> Before passing the blame on Safari, it might be a good idea to check your internet speed. That way, you can make sure Safari is the issue and rule out anything else before continuing.</p><p> If you’re connected to Wi-Fi, open another computer or device on the same Wi-Fi network, then head to <a class="link"   href="https://www.speedtest.net/" >Speedtest’s site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and check your internet speed. You won’t want to do this on your iPhone, as Safari issues can slow your connection time, giving you a false negative.</p><p> If your internet speed is fast, then Safari is the issue, and it’s time to fix it.</p><h2 id="1-Close-All-Your-Safari-Tabs"><a href="#1-Close-All-Your-Safari-Tabs" class="headerlink" title="1. Close All Your Safari Tabs"></a>1. Close All Your Safari Tabs</h2><p> Safari can usually handle a lot of bandwidth and keep many pages open. However, some websites drain Safari data. By closing all the currently open tabs, you can confirm if one of the open websites was using too much data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/safari-tab-page.jpg"                      alt="Safari home page on an iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/safari-close-tabs-1.jpg"                      alt="Safari Tab options in iOS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHPljBHrvkA?si=HwdfDM9rlbABSIrx&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/safari-delete-tabs.jpg"                      alt="Closing tabs in Safari"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4lRBnNnd9k?si=5e0MbdOz-fF6Ry_k&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> To close all the tabs on Safari, open Safari and hold the<strong>Tab</strong> button in the bottom right-hand corner. A prompt will appear for you to close all the tabs. Once this appears, hit<strong>Close All Tabs</strong> . Then, give Safari a try again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2cXnI9oOvM?si=3nz2sBB124ln-83T&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Clear-Your-Browsing-History-and-Data"><a href="#2-Clear-Your-Browsing-History-and-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.

To clear Safari, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Clear History and Data</strong> .</p><p> Once you do this, relaunch Safari and see if it’s loading up pages quickly enough. If it’s faster for a little while but begins to slow down again, proceed to the next tip.</p><h2 id="3-Check-Your-iPhone’s-Storage"><a href="#3-Check-Your-iPhone’s-Storage" class="headerlink" title="3. Check Your iPhone’s Storage"></a>3. Check Your iPhone’s Storage</h2><p> If your iPhone storage is almost full, that means it can’t handle much else. Safari, like most apps, uses device storage to store data from the app. And low storage means Safari won’t have enough memory to work.</p><p> This is why some users find Safari temporarily faster once they clear their browsing history and data. However, some users might have used so much storage that Safari might not even speed up when you clear the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iphone-settings-menu-general.jpg"                      alt="iphone settings menu general"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/58KlTPHv8dU?si=7ICagyNgrao7OkVO&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iphone-general-settings.jpg"                      alt="iphone general settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iphone-storage-capacity.jpg"                      alt="iphone storage capacity"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1g4U13PBk0?si=xJLJtlc4hKBTBH8M&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> Luckily, it’s easy to check if this is an issue. All you need to do is head to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Storage</strong> and see how much space your iPhone has used. And if it’s almost full, you might have to delete some large files.</p><p> However, if you don’t want to lose precious data, consider <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/finally-time-buy-icloud-storage/" >signing up for a paid iCloud plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHafwnWSEQk?si=rejNVNpJZH2SqNLy&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Reset-Network-Settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="4.

Doing this will reset all network-related connections on your iPhone, hopefully speeding up Safari in the process. Head to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings</strong> to do this.</p><p> Once you do this, you’ll need to set up your network connections again. This means re-entering your Wi-Fi passwords. However, it can clear up a lot of bugs, so it is worth a try if all else fails. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-factory-reset-iphone-ipad/" >reset your iPhone to factory settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Browse-Seamlessly-in-Safari"><a href="#Browse-Seamlessly-in-Safari" class="headerlink" title="Browse Seamlessly in Safari"></a>Browse Seamlessly in Safari</h2><p> Safari comes pre-installed on all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And since it’s the native browser, it works seamlessly across all your apps and Apple devices.</p><p> While switching to a third-party browser like Chrome might seem tempting when Safari is slow or lagging, you’ll miss out on a seamless experience. So, it’s worth taking the time to fix whatever issue you’re facing.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-streamline-your-life-with-these-5-chrome-tools-for-fb-video-grabs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Streamline Your Life with These 5 Chrome Tools for FB Video Grabs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-optimal-strategy-for-broadcasting-via-obs-on-fb-live-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Optimal Strategy for Broadcasting via OBS on FB Live for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-lava-agni-2-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages?

In fact, Apple users have the option to see exactly how much time they spend across their various iOS and Mac devices with Screen Time.</p><p> Unfortunately, some Apple users have faced an iPhone Screen Time glitch and are shocked to see unexpected websites in their Screen Time settings, for hours at a time, without ever having viewed them.</p><p> So, why are random websites taking up your Screen Time, and how do you fix it?

It can be worrying if it’s a vital app you use for finance, productivity, or work.</p><p> Sometimes, we may intentionally hide an app, forget about it, and then struggle to locate it when needed, whereas other times, the app seems to have disappeared from the Home Screen of your iPhone.</p><p> Whatever the case, if you can’t unhide apps or notice that some apps are missing from your iPhone’s Home Screen, here’s how to find them.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7fATC_lI7o?si=UFotPJqflDRZr-mv&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Find-Your-App-in-the-App-Library"><a href="#1-Find-Your-App-in-the-App-Library" class="headerlink" title="1.

Swipe left on the last<strong>Home Screen</strong> page to reach<strong>App Library</strong> . Then, use the<strong>Search</strong> box to find your missing app quickly.</p><p> Once you find the app you’re looking for, long-press its app icon in the App Library, and if this app isn’t on the Home Screen, you will see an option to<strong>Add to Home Screen</strong> .

Once you do, you can also long-press the app icon and select the<strong>Add to Home Screen</strong> option or manually drag it onto the Home Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_5638.jpg"                      alt="iphone home screen"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_5639.jpg"                      alt="iphone search screen"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_5640.jpg"                      alt="use search to find an app in iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-Ask-Siri-to-Open-the-Missing-App"><a href="#3-Ask-Siri-to-Open-the-Missing-App" class="headerlink" title="3.

After a while, it’s possible to forget about them.</p><p> If this is your situation, open all the app folders on your iPhone Home Screen and look for the missing app inside. Once you find it, you may want to drag the app icon out of the folder onto the Home Screen.</p><h2 id="5-Check-Screen-Time-to-Unhide-Restricted-Apps"><a href="#5-Check-Screen-Time-to-Unhide-Restricted-Apps" class="headerlink" title="5.

As a result, you won’t find the app icons for these restricted apps on the Home Screen or the App Library. They won’t even appear in Spotlight search results or be accessible via Siri.</p><p> To unhide these apps, open<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Screen Time</strong> &gt;<strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong> &gt;<strong>Allowed Apps</strong> and ensure all the apps are allowed. Next, tap<strong>Back</strong> , go to<strong>Content Restrictions</strong> &gt;<strong>Apps</strong> , and select<strong>Allow All Apps</strong> . Alternatively, you can also <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/turn-off-screen-time/" >turn off Screen Time on your iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to remove all the restrictions at once.</p><p> After doing this, you should see the missing app icons on the Home Screen and App Library. If not, you’ll have to use the Spotlight search method explained above to re-add them to the Home Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-content--privacy-restrictions-in-iphone-screen-time-settings.png"                      alt="Tap Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions in iPhone Screen Time Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hS27nZVi9Y?si=_Zqj_l4a4XkPqT2S&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-allowed-apps-in-iphone-screen-time-settings.png"                      alt="Tap Allowed Apps in iPhone Screen Time Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFQCEZiYA08?si=xjIu5IAy77RlHWii&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/make-sure-all-iphone-apps-are-allowed-and-nothing-is-restricted.png"                      alt="Make Sure all iPhone apps are allowed and nothing is restricted"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=M69YSY0Mk_gsdU0Q&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Unhide-Home-Screen-Pages-to-See-All-Your-Apps"><a href="#6-Unhide-Home-Screen-Pages-to-See-All-Your-Apps" class="headerlink" title="6.

If you want to continue retaining a minimalist Home Screen, you can access the downloaded apps in the App Library or restore your Home Screen pages by unhiding them.</p><p> To avoid confusion in the future, learn more about <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/hide-iphone-home-screen-pages/" >hiding and unhiding the Home Screen pages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Use-App-Store-to-Check-If-an-App-Is-Installed-or-Not"><a href="#7-Use-App-Store-to-Check-If-an-App-Is-Installed-or-Not" class="headerlink" title="7.

After this, the Home Screen will show all the Apple apps (just like a new iPhone). And the apps you have downloaded will be placed alphabetically in order.</p><p>Here’s how to reset your iPhone’s Home Screen layout:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> and tap<strong>General</strong> .</li><li>Scroll to the bottom and tap<strong>Transfer or Reset iPhone</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset Home Screen Layout</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-general-in-iphone-settings-app.png"                      alt="Tap General in iPhone Settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/from-the-bottom-tap-reset-in-iphone-settings.png"                      alt="From the bottom tap Reset in iPhone Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-reset-home-screen-layout-in-iphone-settings.png"                      alt="Tap Reset Home Screen Layout in iPhone Settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="9-Additional-Fixes-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-an-App"><a href="#9-Additional-Fixes-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-an-App" class="headerlink" title="9.

Additional Fixes if You Still Can’t Find an App</h2><p> Most of the methods we covered above involve unhiding an app and getting it back on the Home Screen again. But if those don’t work, an app disappearing may be caused by a glitch.</p><p> In this case, you can use generic (but frequently effective) solutions such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restarting your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You should also update your iPhone to ensure your device receives bug fixes from the latest version of iOS. Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> to check if an iOS update is available.</p><h2 id="Hopefully-You-Found-the-Missing-iPhone-App"><a href="#Hopefully-You-Found-the-Missing-iPhone-App" class="headerlink" title="Hopefully, You Found the Missing iPhone App"></a>Hopefully, You Found the Missing iPhone App</h2><p> These were the quick ways to find any missing or hidden apps on iPhone. Sometimes if you can’t find an app, you likely deleted it. In this case, re-download it from the App Store.</p><p> Additionally, it’s possible that the app was removed from the App Store by the developer or Apple (as was the case with Flappy Bird and Fortnite, respectively). In such situations, you will have to use one of its alternatives.</p><p> If it’s often difficult to find apps or open them quickly, it might be worth allocating some time to organize your iPhone’s Home Screen layout to help with that.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-convert-your-instagram-followers-into-earnings/"><u>2024 Approved How to Convert Your Instagram Followers Into Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/airpods-dynamic-sound-movement-problem-heres-how-you-can-disable-that/"><u>AirPods' Dynamic Sound Movement Problem?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black is the result of multiple refinements since the original model, and through its many iterations, it’s become one of the most popular and high-tech action cameras on the market. From insanely advanced image stabilization to live streaming capabilities, the HERO7 Black is built for more than just action shots.</p><p> We recently got our hands on this tiny powerhouse to see if the improvements in software and video quality are worth its asking price.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Design-Classic-action-camera-design"><a href="#Design-Classic-action-camera-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Classic action camera design"></a><strong>Design: Classic action camera design</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black measures in at 2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 inches, so it’s super compact and almost a cube. The device is all black with a very nice rubber casing around the unit that makes it feel soft to the touch.</p><p> The design is very minimal. The power button is located on the right side of the camera and a record button at the top. On the side, there is a door that hides the USB and HDMI ports, and another door on the bottom that conceals the battery and MicroSD port. The front of the camera has a small screen that displays the current settings.</p><p> All these doors protect the camera’s ports from the elements and give it a tough outer shell that’s rugged enough to survive rough falls and submersion in up to 33 feet of water. The HERO7 Black is a great travel camera that can be taken on exotic trips where water adventures and rough terrain are a part of your itinerary.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black we noticed that the body of the device becomes very hot when used for long periods of time. We tested it for a few hours nonstop and noticed it was still very warm even when it was not recording. This can be a big concern if the device is used for long recordings in hot temperatures.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-and-visible"><a href="#Display-Bright-and-visible" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright and visible"></a><strong>Display: Bright and visible</strong></h2><p> The back of the GoPro HERO7 Black has a two-inch touchscreen that is bright and easy to read. While testing the camera, we were able to navigate through the menus with the single touch of a finger, which are intuitive and easy to adjust. Simply tap to select.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup: Updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black did not have much battery life out of the box. Once we powered it on, we set the date, time, and location. It then prompted us to update the software, which required a blank memory card and fully-charged battery to complete.</p><p> The HERO7 Black has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth compatibility, which makes it easy to pair with a smartphone that has the GoPro App downloaded. We were able to make the camera discoverable in the Preferences menu, and then the app could automatically scan and connect to the camera when it was opened.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Sensor-Small-but-mighty"><a href="#Sensor-Small-but-mighty" class="headerlink" title="Sensor: Small but mighty"></a><strong>Sensor: Small but mighty</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black boasts a 1&#x2F;2.3-inch 12-megapixel sensor that is built for action. The new and improved image processor now has the ability to stabilize footage through electronic image stabilization technology called HyperSmooth. This feature works by tracking unwanted motion in your videos and algorithmically correcting shake. It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><p> We took the GoPro out and recorded some handheld video as we walked around, which would normally have some shake to it. The footage from the HERO7 Black was smooth and it did not contain any camera shake, almost as if we’d been using a gimbal.</p><p> It makes your footage impressively stable even when filming handheld or while riding on rough terrain.</p><h2 id="Lens-Great-for-video"><a href="#Lens-Great-for-video" class="headerlink" title="Lens: Great for video"></a><strong>Lens: Great for video</strong></h2><p> The fixed lens on the GoPro HERO7 Black shoots wide or in SuperView mode, the latter of which is an extra-wide field of view and can sometimes give a kind of distorted fisheye effect to your footage. This distortion can be frustrating, but there are ways to work around it during editing, including using video editing software to correct. And when shooting at a lower resolution, the camera can shoot with a linear field of view which reduces the distortion of the lens. The SuperView is not available when shooting in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p><h2 id="Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates"><a href="#Video-Quality-Amazing-4K-quality-with-variable-frame-rates" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates"></a><strong>Video Quality: Amazing 4K quality with variable frame rates</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quality of the GoPro HERO7 Black is gorgeous. Content creators and travel vloggers will absolutely appreciate this camera’s recording capabilities.</p><p> While testing the GoPro HERO7 Black, the 4K video looked its best when recording in bright lighting conditions. In lower light, the quality began to degrade and grain started to form in the shadow areas of the scene.</p><p> New to the GoPro HERO7 is the ability to create a TimeWarp video. This feature allows the user to create super smooth time-lapse videos with HyperSmooth technology, so the camera doesn’t have to be stationary. This opens up the ability to be more creative when making time lapse videos.</p><p> The ability to capture 1080p video at 240fps is also a game-changer. The slow-motion feature of this camera is stunning, producing beautiful smooth footage, especially when used in bright lighting conditions. If you’re an athlete looking to record and analyze footage of yourself, the HERO7 Black gives you a great way to slow down footage and study movement.</p><p> The GoPro HERO7 also has a live stream feature. Using the GoPro app, you can set up a live video feed by connecting to your Facebook, YouTube, and various other social media networks. Once connected to the desired account, you will be able to go live within minutes.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDuvbv0QOYI?si=byottcEM_Rrvi4EL&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about"><a href="#Photo-Quality-Nothing-to-brag-about" class="headerlink" title="Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about"></a><strong>Photo Quality: Nothing to brag about</strong></h2><p> The photo quality on the GoPro HERO7 Black is average, though it does have the ability to create HDR (High Dynamic Range) images.</p><p> Due to the lens distortion, the images that this camera produces have a specific look that you may either love or hate. It also has a fixed lens that does not zoom, so that limits its functionality compared to typical point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> But generally speaking, the GoPro HERO7 Black is not a camera known for its stunning photographs—it is known for its stunning video capabilities. It’s not for someone that wants to use it specifically for still photographs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yr0yS_Ywrjs?si=QxzYiX1KmUaExmlo&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Sensitive-to-the-touch" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Sensitive to the touch</strong></h2><p> The GoPro HERO7 Black’s microphones are sensitive and record ambient noise easily. The microphones are located on the body of the camera and any slight touch becomes audible in your video. When taking some handheld footage, we accidentally covered up the microphones with our fingers, which caused the audio to sound muffled in our video.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera.</p><p> The internal microphones are useful if the sound is not a priority in your videos, but if great audio is a necessity, it is best to invest in an external microphone. You can connect one to the HERO7 Black through the USB connection, which opens up possibilities for external microphones, lapel mics, and digital audio recorders to enhance sound recording capabilities.</p><p> The ability to add external microphones turns the GoPro HERO7 Black from an action camera to a high-quality video camera. Pairing the 4K resolution with great audio quality, this camera becomes a powerful tool in the hands of the right content creator.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeff Dojillo</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing"><a href="#Connectivity-Speedy-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-pairing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Speedy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairing</strong></h2><p> Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze with the GoPro HERO7 Black. Once we installed the GoPro app on our smartphone, the camera connected instantly. The app also gave us a much larger and easier-to-read interface, plus a live view function that allowed us to use our phone to frame and compose videos and remotely control the camera.</p><p> Inside the app, there are also options to edit mode settings, change the original set up, review camera info, changed Wi-Fi remotes, as well as monitor the battery level and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-format-sd-card-camera-4587017" >SD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capacity. It also makes it easier to review footage and images that the camera captures.</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-High-res-video-drains-it-quickly"><a href="#Battery-Life-High-res-video-drains-it-quickly" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: High-res video drains it quickly"></a><strong>Battery Life: High-res video drains it quickly</strong></h2><p> When recording 4K video at 60 fps, the HERO7 Black’s battery only lasts about 50 minutes, so if you’re going to be shooting all day, it would be smart to have a few extra batteries available.</p><p> Another option to extend shooting time would be to connect the GoPro HERO7 Black to an external battery pack via the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Price-Fairly-priced-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Fairly-priced-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Fairly priced for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Fairly priced for what you get</strong></h2><p> Retailing for $400 but often selling for less, the GoPro HERO7 Black is reasonably priced for its amazing features. 4K recording, HyperSmooth image stabilization, high frame rates, Bluetooth connectivity, a waterproof body, and live streaming features make this camera well worth the asking price.</p><p> Perfect for adventurers, filmmakers, and vloggers that need a rugged and compact camera to create content on the go.</p><p> The portability of the GoPro HERO7 Black is perfect for adventurers, filmmakers, and vloggers that need a rugged and compact camera to create content on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/465CTOm8om0?si=63RxowNMCFA4fPUa&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Less-rugged-but-better-with-still-photography"><a href="#Competition-Less-rugged-but-better-with-still-photography" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Less rugged, but better with still photography"></a><strong>Competition: Less rugged, but better with still photography</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II:</em></strong> The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II retails for $700, and though it usually sells for between $600 and $650, it’s still considerably more expensive than the GoPro HERO7 Black. For those who are considering the GoPro as a vlogging camera, the PowerShot is another great option. It records video at 1080p rather than 4K, but it has a larger 20.3-megapixel sensor and a 180-degree articulating LCD touchscreen display that’s perfect for self-recording.</p><p> The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II utilizes an advanced DIGIC 7 Image Processor, which creates better photographs than the GoPro HERO7 Black. This image processor also provides better video stabilization and autofocusing for video, though it’s admittedly not as advanced as the GoPro’s HyperSmooth feature.</p><p> Comparing this to the GoPro HERO7 Black, the Canon is much more user-friendly. It’s a better fit for those that want a versatile camera that they can grab and use easily, without having to maneuver through menus on a tiny screen.</p><p><strong><em>Canon PowerShot SX740 HS:</em></strong> Retailing for $400, the Canon PowerShot SX740 HS is right on par price-wise with the GoPro HERO7 Black. The PowerShot is also capable of recording 4K video, but it lacks the frame rates that the GoPro HERO7 Black is capable of. It’s also capable of capturing photos without distortion, which makes it a more versatile camera.</p><p> The PowerShot SX740 HS is geared toward someone that wants a little bit of everything. It can shoot 4K and take photographs, but it doesn’t quite live up to the excellent video quality of the GoPro. The PowerShot is also a more user-friendly device that is suited for people familiar with standard point-and-shoot cameras.</p><p> The camera also has a 180-degree adjustable LCD screen, which makes it an even more powerful tool for vloggers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-sx740-hs-review-4705542" >Canon PowerShot SX740 HS Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A rugged and compact action camera with fantastic video stabilization.</strong></p><p> Between the amazing video quality and the enhanced HyperSmooth electronic image stabilization, the GoPro HERO7 Black is perfect for adventurers who want to record or even live-stream their most rugged expeditions. It produces beautiful videos with enhanced color and sharpness and is small enough to wear or mount somewhere without it getting in the way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-COuhPT5mk?si=wLZU6jkkAdJuAn6h&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/akaso-ek7000-pro-4k-action-camera-review-4770265" >AKASO EK7000 Pro 4K Action Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-review-4706895" >Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-dsc-w800-review-4589510" >Sony DSC-W800 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwOwUI47FuU?si=NK7IEELjx7_SJSl2&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  HERO7 Black</li><li>Product Brand  GoPro</li><li>MPN  CHDHX-701</li><li>Price  $399.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  2.4 x 1.3 x 1.8 in.</li><li>Sensor  12MP, 1-Chip CMOS</li><li>Video  Up to 4K at 60 fps, or 1080p at 240 fps</li><li>Audio Format  WAV</li><li>Photo ISO Range  100 - 3200 (Auto)</li><li>Burst Photos  30 photos&#x2F;sec</li><li>Output  1 x micro-HDMI (Type D)</li><li>Video ISO Range  100 - 6400 (Auto)</li><li>Input  1 x USB 3.0</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-free-srt-tools-the-most-reliable-high-quality-apps-listed-for-2024/"><u>[New] Free SRT Tools The Most Reliable, High-Quality Apps Listed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-pinnacle-5-iphone-apps-for-auditory-escapades/"><u>[New] Pinnacle 5 iPhone Apps for Auditory Escapades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/airplay-not-working-heres-how-you-can-fix-it/"><u>AirPlay Not Working?

This might help you narrow it down to work, home, or the supermarket. But you’ll still struggle to find it if it’s tucked beneath a couch cushion or at the bottom of the laundry basket.</p><p> Fortunately, you can use Find My to make your iPhone play a loud sound, making it easier to find when you’re nearby.</p><p> You’ll find the<strong>Play Sound</strong> button once you select your missing iPhone in Find My, whether you’re using the web client or the native app on iPhone or iPad. On a Mac, remember to click the<strong>Info (i)</strong> button after selecting it to access this option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/playing-sound-in-find-my-app.png"                      alt="playing sound in find my app"                ></p><p> Your iPhone will keep playing a sound until you find and unlock it or someone else powers off the device.

And if your missing iPhone doesn’t have a passcode set, you’ll be prompted to create one.</p><p> You can also use Lost Mode to display a message on the screen telling whoever finds it that this device belongs to you, along with details on how to reach you. Your device will still receive phone calls in Lost Mode, but it won’t display any alerts.</p><p> To enable Lost Mode, select your device in Find My and hit<strong>Activate</strong> under the<strong>Mark As Lost</strong> option. Then, follow the prompts to create a passcode (if you don’t already have one) and write a message for people to see when they find your iPhone. Then, choose<strong>Activate</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/marking-device-as-lost.png"                      alt="marking device as lost in Find My"                ></p><p> Lost Mode keeps your data intact.

However, you should only use this option if you never expect to find your missing device again.</p><p> Once you use Find My to erase a missing iPhone, you can’t track its location anymore. No one else can use your device because it’s locked to your Apple ID with Activation Lock. But you’re unlikely to find it again because you can’t use Find My to see where it is.</p><p> We only recommend this option if you’ve given up on ever getting your device back. You’ll find the<strong>Erase This Device</strong> option at the bottom once you select your iPhone in Find My.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/erasing-lost-iphone.png"                      alt="erasing lost iPhone in Find My"                ></p><p> Keep in mind that your iPhone must be connected to the internet to start this process. Otherwise, you’ll notice that the erase is pending on Find My.</p><p> Apple’s Find My app makes locating a lost or stolen iPhone easy. But this isn’t the only tool at your disposal. In fact, there are other <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-find-your-lost-iphone/" >ways to find your lost iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which can be handy if you have Find My disabled.</p><p> For instance, you can check Google’s timeline, ask friends and family members, or try calling your phone number to listen for the ring if it’s nearby. With these tips, you should be able to get your iPhone back in no time.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-io-screen-recording-essentials-quick-start-for-2024/"><u>[New] IO Screen Recording Essentials Quick Start for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-pro-anglers-choice-the-top-5-cameras-for-fishing/"><u>[New] Pro Angler's Choice The Top 5 Cameras For Fishing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-youtubes-potential-10-mpeg-conversion-tips/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unlocking YouTube's Potential 10 MPEG Conversion Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-expert-screenshot-solutions-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Expert Screenshot Solutions Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-intrinsic-storytelling-principles/"><u>2024 Approved Intrinsic Storytelling Principles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/facetime-malfunctioning-here-are-15-quick-fixes-that-can-help-you-connect-easily/"><u>FaceTime Malfunctioning?

You’re not alone, as many reports have surfaced online regarding this issue. Here’s everything you need to know about iPhone 14’s battery issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHPljBHrvkA?si=HwdfDM9rlbABSIrx&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="iPhone-14-Owners-Report-Battery-Health-Problems"><a href="#iPhone-14-Owners-Report-Battery-Health-Problems" class="headerlink" title="iPhone 14 Owners Report Battery Health Problems"></a>iPhone 14 Owners Report Battery Health Problems</h2><p> Several months after the release of the iPhone 14, users started noticing how quickly their iPhone batteries had degraded. iPhone 14 users on Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and other social media platforms shared screenshots showing that battery health had dropped drastically within a year of normal usage.</p><p> Reports varied, with some users experiencing a decline to 90 percent and more alarming cases suggesting drops to as low as 85 percent. Surprisingly, some users even claimed that iPhones purchased on launch day did not have 100 percent battery health.</p><p> Although the iPhone 14 Pro is supposed to have a better battery life than its predecessor due to its slightly larger battery, we observed that the iPhone 13 Pro lasts slightly longer under real-world use. Even Apple enthusiasts who tend to upgrade their devices every year noticed that the iPhone 14’s battery life situation differs greatly from their past experiences.</p><p> iPhones use lithium-ion batteries, so the amount of charge they withhold diminishes as they chemically age. According to an <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387" >Apple Support document <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a standard iPhone battery is designed to maintain up to 80 percent of its original capacity after approximately 500 complete charge cycles under normal conditions. This typically translates to an average lifespan of around two years.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-the-iPhone-14’s-Battery-Health-Draining-So-Fast"><a href="#Why-Is-the-iPhone-14’s-Battery-Health-Draining-So-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Why Is the iPhone 14’s Battery Health Draining So Fast?"></a>Why Is the iPhone 14’s Battery Health Draining So Fast?</h2><p> Since Apple has not addressed these complaints directly, one can never be sure of the reason behind the rapid drain of the iPhone 14’s battery health. So, we can only speculate.</p><p> The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max were the first iPhone models to feature the always-on display, which is enabled by default. The feature dims the Lock Screen and reduces the refresh rate to as low as 1 Hz when your iPhone is idle. While there are numerous <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-we-love-always-on-display-on-iphone/" >reasons to love the always-on display on the iPhone 14 Pro models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it unfortunately drains the battery quite a bit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charge-your-iphone-with-a-wireless-charger.jpg"                      alt="iPhone being charged with a MagSafe charger"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8U3ooyFiAB4?si=yXPQrDhMBEJwN2EZ&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> We also suspect that wireless charging may be behind the iPhone 14’s rapid battery degradation. This is because people who use wireless chargers have reported that their iPhone’s battery health has dropped quicker compared to those who don’t.</p><p> Ultimately, each device’s battery life depends on various factors, like your daily usage and how often you charge it. However, since this is a widespread issue and is not limited to a few people, it’s likely a design flaw.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kx-Pb0otJCs?si=Mvr49yQVesmJA8-O&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Preserve-Your-iPhone-14’s-Battery-Health"><a href="#How-to-Preserve-Your-iPhone-14’s-Battery-Health" class="headerlink" title="How to Preserve Your iPhone 14’s Battery Health"></a>How to Preserve Your iPhone 14’s Battery Health</h2><p> If the damage has already been done, you’re left with two options: opt for a battery replacement or direct your efforts toward preserving your iPhone 14’s battery health. Apple states that devices with a battery health capacity exceeding 80 percent are not eligible for in-warranty replacement and that a certain degree of battery degradation is considered normal.</p><p> Even if you have an AppleCare+ plan, unless your iPhone 14’s battery health has dipped below 80 percent within your warranty period, you’ll need to pay $99 to get the battery replaced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/always-on-display-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="Always-on display on iPhone 14 Pro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6lCtLUeROA?si=se6OFuis9JpcTGJf&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/09/apple-debuts-iphone-14-pro-and-iphone-14-pro-max/" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Luckily, if you aren’t willing to pay an additional fee to replace your iPhone’s battery, there are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-maintain-your-iphones-battery-health/" >numerous ways to maintain your iPhone’s battery health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> For instance, it’s a good idea to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/turn-off-always-on-display-iphone/" >turn off the Always-On display on the iPhone 14 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You can also preserve your iPhone’s battery health by using Low Power Mode, avoiding charging your device for too long, and enabling <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-optimized-battery-charging/" >Optimized Battery Charging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to slow down charging past 80 percent.</p><h2 id="Apple-Needs-to-Address-iPhone-14’s-Battery-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Needs-to-Address-iPhone-14’s-Battery-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Needs to Address iPhone 14’s Battery Issues"></a>Apple Needs to Address iPhone 14’s Battery Issues</h2><p> It’s undeniably concerning that hundreds of iPhone 14 users are witnessing a significant decrease of more than 10 percent in their battery health within months of regular usage. Given the scale of the problem, we hope that Apple rectifies this issue with its newer devices and offers free battery replacements for existing iPhone 14 owners.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-elevate-engagement-youtube-insights-for-timing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevate Engagement Youtube Insights for Timing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-flexibility-in-viewing-with-youtube-tv-options/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Flexibility in Viewing with YouTube TV Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-complete-guide-to-help-you-convert-srt-to-xml-ssa-ttml-and-other-formats/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Complete Guide to Help You Convert SRT to XML, SSA, TTML, and Other Formats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unseen-snaps-and-silence-could-be-a-block/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unseen Snaps and Silence Could Be a Block</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-quintessential-list-best-tales-from-youtube-in-23/"><u>2024 Approved The Quintessential List Best Tales From YouTube in '23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/5-essential-tips-to-keep-your-iphone-connected-to-wi-fi-without-dropping-signal/"><u>5 Essential Tips to Keep Your iPhone Connected to Wi-Fi without Dropping Signal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-get-your-iphone-alarm-back-on-track-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>How To Get Your iPhone Alarm Back On Track: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/improving-your-instagram-performance-a-guide-with-6-tips-for-iphone-and-android-users/"><u>Improving Your Instagram Performance: A Guide with 6 Tips for iPhone & Android Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-capture-clarity-best-webcams-to-elevate-your-podcasts/"><u>In 2024, Capture Clarity Best Webcams to Elevate Your Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/no-itunes-needed-how-to-perform-a-fresh-start-on-your-iphone/"><u>No iTunes Needed: How to Perform a Fresh Start on Your iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/overcome-vpn-connectivity-challenges-on-your-ios-device-with-these-tips/"><u>Overcome VPN Connectivity Challenges on Your iOS Device with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/the-definitive-walkthrough-returning-your-iphoneipad-settings-to-factory-defaults-made-simple/"><u>The Definitive Walkthrough: Returning Your iPhone/iPad Settings to Factory Defaults Made Simple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/top-4-android-system-repair-software-for-tecno-camon-20-pro-5g-bricked-devices-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Top 4 Android System Repair Software for Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G Bricked Devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Could This Be an Indicator That You’ve Been Blocked on iMessage?"></a>Baffled by Technology? Could This Be an Indicator That You’ve Been Blocked on iMessage?</h2><p> iMessages are texts and media sent between Apple devices over an internet connection. A successfully sent iMessage appears as a blue text bubble in your chat conversation.</p><p> However, you’re probably here because you noticed your messages are sent as a green text bubble instead of blue or perhaps saw a “Sent as Text Message” note at the bottom of the bubble.</p><p> What does this mean? Have you been blocked? Below, we explain why you’re probably not blocked, why your iMessage is sent as a text message, and how to actually test whether you’re blocked or not.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="iMessage-Sent-as-Text-Message-Does-This-Mean-You’re-Blocked"><a href="#iMessage-Sent-as-Text-Message-Does-This-Mean-You’re-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="iMessage Sent as Text Message: Does This Mean You’re Blocked?"></a>iMessage Sent as Text Message: Does This Mean You’re Blocked?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-1.jpg"                      alt="person wearing grey hoodie with hands holding iphone"                ></p><p> The truth is that you can’t tell if a person has blocked you based on the fact that your iMessage was sent as a text message alone. Regardless of whether you were blocked or not, you’ll still hear the sound of the green bubble text being successfully sent as usual. The message doesn’t bounce back. You can continue to send messages to the recipient.</p><p> Therefore, an iMessage sent as a text message on your iPhone does not immediately indicate that your number is blocked by the recipient. There are other reasons why your messages show up as green bubbles when you send them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OxkndZbIA4?si=TWJlkTbYKsVag8-q&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Reasons-Why-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message"><a href="#4-Reasons-Why-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message" class="headerlink" title="4 Reasons Why Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message"></a>4 Reasons Why Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-2.jpg"                      alt="man sending text message on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=3YDfzJAZMDp1gFRz&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> When your iMessage is sent as a text message, it’s worth checking whether the root cause of the issue lies with your iPhone first.</p><p> iMessage texts sending in green instead of blue is a common problem when the service stops functioning as it should, so apply various <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/imessage-not-working-on-mac-iphone-ipad/" >troubleshooting methods to fix iMessage on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first.</p><p> But if you have gone through the fixes and your device appears to have no issues, the problem is likely on the recipient’s end. However, it doesn’t mean you’re blocked either. There are a few simple reasons why your iMessage is sent as a text message to them.</p><h3 id="1-The-Recipient’s-Device-Is-Not-Connected-to-the-Internet"><a href="#1-The-Recipient’s-Device-Is-Not-Connected-to-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="1. The Recipient’s Device Is Not Connected to the Internet"></a>1. The Recipient’s Device Is Not Connected to the Internet</h3><p> For a text to be successfully sent as an iMessage, the recipient’s Apple device must also be connected to the internet. Otherwise, the iMessage will be sent as a text message to their device, or you might see an <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-imessage-not-delivered/" >“iMessage Not Delivered” error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your iPhone if it’s not sent out.</p><h3 id="2-The-Recipient-Wasn’t-Using-an-Apple-Device-at-the-Time"><a href="#2-The-Recipient-Wasn’t-Using-an-Apple-Device-at-the-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. The Recipient Wasn’t Using an Apple Device at the Time"></a>2. The Recipient Wasn’t Using an Apple Device at the Time</h3><p> Remember, iMessage only works between Apple devices. So, if your family or friend switches from an iPhone to an Android smartphone, for example, your iMessage will automatically be sent as a text message to them.</p><p> Your iPhone does not notify you that they have changed devices, even if your previous chat conversations were held using iMessage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxv4NM-89CU?si=Uj5rOkhrwZ_6QIuW&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-The-Recipient’s-Device-Was-Turned-Off"><a href="#3-The-Recipient’s-Device-Was-Turned-Off" class="headerlink" title="3.

When this happens, you can still continue to message them. However, your iMessage will be sent as a text message or simply remain pending until the other party turns on their device again.</p><h3 id="4-The-Recipient-Disabled-iMessage-on-Their-iPhone"><a href="#4-The-Recipient-Disabled-iMessage-on-Their-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="4. The Recipient Disabled iMessage on Their iPhone"></a>4. The Recipient Disabled iMessage on Their iPhone</h3><p> iMessage is a feature that can be enabled and disabled in the iPhone’s Settings app. For whatever reason, your contact may have chosen to turn off iMessage.</p><p> If this happens, you’ll be unable to send and receive iMessages from them. However, both of you can still reach each other with SMS text messages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfEPmG_O6F8?si=93ZTVtH_zjFRz5eh&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Test-if-Someone-Blocked-You-From-Contacting-Them"><a href="#How-to-Test-if-Someone-Blocked-You-From-Contacting-Them" class="headerlink" title="How to Test if Someone Blocked You From Contacting Them"></a>How to Test if Someone Blocked You From Contacting Them</h2><p> There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/find-out-if-someone-blocked-your-phone-number/" >ways to check if someone has blocked your phone number <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In this case, the most effective method is to simply call your target recipient. An iPhone user can’t choose to block you on iMessage without blocking you entirely. Therefore, if the call goes through, it confirms that you’re not blocked.</p><p> If the call doesn’t go through, you shouldn’t immediately start panicking either. There are a variety of reasons why you’re <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-iphone-cant-make-calls/" >unable to make phone calls on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Poor call signal in an area is one of the biggest culprits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3-1.jpg"                      alt="woman making a call on iphone with white case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNw3Lb26wFA?si=5NR1XRVSp41EQYMy&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Therefore, you can also reach out to your recipient via third-party apps such as WhatsApp or Messenger. If you’re still connected on those platforms, it’s unlikely that the person had any intention to cut you off, and the issues of being unable to call them or send them an iMessage were likely minor technical hiccups.</p><h2 id="Don’t-Panic-When-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message"><a href="#Don’t-Panic-When-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Panic When Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message"></a>Don’t Panic When Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message</h2><p> Due to its dependence on an internet connection, it’s common for an iMessage to fail and be sent as a text message when connectivity issues crop up.</p><p> If you’ve been worried that you were blocked because your iMessage was sent as a text message, we hope our explanation has helped reassure you that it’s a very unlikely case.</p><p> Therefore, don’t panic or jump to conclusions quickly.

A successfully sent iMessage appears as a blue text bubble in your chat conversation.</p><p> However, you’re probably here because you noticed your messages are sent as a green text bubble instead of blue or perhaps saw a “Sent as Text Message” note at the bottom of the bubble.</p><p> What does this mean? Have you been blocked? Below, we explain why you’re probably not blocked, why your iMessage is sent as a text message, and how to actually test whether you’re blocked or not.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBCobAYzzcc?si=J3eSTQ3AdyxWAjGo&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="iMessage-Sent-as-Text-Message-Does-This-Mean-You’re-Blocked"><a href="#iMessage-Sent-as-Text-Message-Does-This-Mean-You’re-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="iMessage Sent as Text Message: Does This Mean You’re Blocked?"></a>iMessage Sent as Text Message: Does This Mean You’re Blocked?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-1.jpg"                      alt="person wearing grey hoodie with hands holding iphone"                ></p><p> The truth is that you can’t tell if a person has blocked you based on the fact that your iMessage was sent as a text message alone. Regardless of whether you were blocked or not, you’ll still hear the sound of the green bubble text being successfully sent as usual. The message doesn’t bounce back. You can continue to send messages to the recipient.</p><p> Therefore, an iMessage sent as a text message on your iPhone does not immediately indicate that your number is blocked by the recipient. There are other reasons why your messages show up as green bubbles when you send them.</p><h2 id="4-Reasons-Why-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message"><a href="#4-Reasons-Why-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message" class="headerlink" title="4 Reasons Why Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message"></a>4 Reasons Why Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-2.jpg"                      alt="man sending text message on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> When your iMessage is sent as a text message, it’s worth checking whether the root cause of the issue lies with your iPhone first.</p><p> iMessage texts sending in green instead of blue is a common problem when the service stops functioning as it should, so apply various <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/imessage-not-working-on-mac-iphone-ipad/" >troubleshooting methods to fix iMessage on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first.</p><p> But if you have gone through the fixes and your device appears to have no issues, the problem is likely on the recipient’s end. However, it doesn’t mean you’re blocked either. There are a few simple reasons why your iMessage is sent as a text message to them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szUqw4TLvWs?si=srv1OeLOe579gLwj&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-The-Recipient’s-Device-Is-Not-Connected-to-the-Internet"><a href="#1-The-Recipient’s-Device-Is-Not-Connected-to-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="1. The Recipient’s Device Is Not Connected to the Internet"></a>1. The Recipient’s Device Is Not Connected to the Internet</h3><p> For a text to be successfully sent as an iMessage, the recipient’s Apple device must also be connected to the internet. Otherwise, the iMessage will be sent as a text message to their device, or you might see an <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-imessage-not-delivered/" >“iMessage Not Delivered” error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your iPhone if it’s not sent out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLb1ViO4WR8?si=g_aiHGNCd7eAvmDM&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-The-Recipient-Wasn’t-Using-an-Apple-Device-at-the-Time"><a href="#2-The-Recipient-Wasn’t-Using-an-Apple-Device-at-the-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. The Recipient Wasn’t Using an Apple Device at the Time"></a>2. The Recipient Wasn’t Using an Apple Device at the Time</h3><p> Remember, iMessage only works between Apple devices. So, if your family or friend switches from an iPhone to an Android smartphone, for example, your iMessage will automatically be sent as a text message to them.</p><p> Your iPhone does not notify you that they have changed devices, even if your previous chat conversations were held using iMessage.</p><h3 id="3-The-Recipient’s-Device-Was-Turned-Off"><a href="#3-The-Recipient’s-Device-Was-Turned-Off" class="headerlink" title="3. The Recipient’s Device Was Turned Off"></a>3. The Recipient’s Device Was Turned Off</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4.jpg"                      alt="iphone on white table placed next to macbook, pens and pink sticky note"                ></p><p> Another simple reason is that your contact may have turned off their iPhone, or their device had shut down because it ran out of battery. When this happens, you can still continue to message them. However, your iMessage will be sent as a text message or simply remain pending until the other party turns on their device again.</p><h3 id="4-The-Recipient-Disabled-iMessage-on-Their-iPhone"><a href="#4-The-Recipient-Disabled-iMessage-on-Their-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="4. The Recipient Disabled iMessage on Their iPhone"></a>4. The Recipient Disabled iMessage on Their iPhone</h3><p> iMessage is a feature that can be enabled and disabled in the iPhone’s Settings app. For whatever reason, your contact may have chosen to turn off iMessage.</p><p> If this happens, you’ll be unable to send and receive iMessages from them. However, both of you can still reach each other with SMS text messages.</p><h2 id="How-to-Test-if-Someone-Blocked-You-From-Contacting-Them"><a href="#How-to-Test-if-Someone-Blocked-You-From-Contacting-Them" class="headerlink" title="How to Test if Someone Blocked You From Contacting Them"></a>How to Test if Someone Blocked You From Contacting Them</h2><p> There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/find-out-if-someone-blocked-your-phone-number/" >ways to check if someone has blocked your phone number <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In this case, the most effective method is to simply call your target recipient. An iPhone user can’t choose to block you on iMessage without blocking you entirely. Therefore, if the call goes through, it confirms that you’re not blocked.</p><p> If the call doesn’t go through, you shouldn’t immediately start panicking either. There are a variety of reasons why you’re <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-iphone-cant-make-calls/" >unable to make phone calls on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Poor call signal in an area is one of the biggest culprits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3-1.jpg"                      alt="woman making a call on iphone with white case"                ></p><p> Therefore, you can also reach out to your recipient via third-party apps such as WhatsApp or Messenger. If you’re still connected on those platforms, it’s unlikely that the person had any intention to cut you off, and the issues of being unable to call them or send them an iMessage were likely minor technical hiccups.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-G7cU8dYvuI?si=JaKqRcW6qq9CDvty&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Don’t-Panic-When-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message"><a href="#Don’t-Panic-When-Your-iMessage-Is-Sent-as-a-Text-Message" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Panic When Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message"></a>Don’t Panic When Your iMessage Is Sent as a Text Message</h2><p> Due to its dependence on an internet connection, it’s common for an iMessage to fail and be sent as a text message when connectivity issues crop up.</p><p> If you’ve been worried that you were blocked because your iMessage was sent as a text message, we hope our explanation has helped reassure you that it’s a very unlikely case.</p><p> Therefore, don’t panic or jump to conclusions quickly.

Looking at your iOS device and seeing that it is disabled can be gut wrenching. Many might not know what happened or how it became disabled or what to do next.</p><p> Luckily, there are a few ways to restore your iPhone or iPad and prevent it getting disabled happening again. Even if you don’t fully understand what happened, this guide will show you how it became disabled and what to do next.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-Do-iPhones-and-iPads-Get-Disabled"><a href="#How-Do-iPhones-and-iPads-Get-Disabled" class="headerlink" title="How Do iPhones and iPads Get Disabled?"></a>How Do iPhones and iPads Get Disabled?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/disabled-iphone-message.png"                      alt="disabled iphone message"                ></p><p> Most iPhones and iPads become disabled after too many failed unlock attempts. If you enter your password wrong six times in a row, for example, you will get a message saying that your iPhone has been disabled for one minute.</p><p> Once that one minute is up, another failed attempt will disable the iPhone for five minutes, then 15 minutes, then 30, and lastly one hour. Sometimes, this can happen without you realizing it, if your device is in a bag and getting knocked around.</p><p> If your iPhone becomes disabled after one hour, one more failed attempt will make the iPhone disabled with no time limit, unless you had set up your iPhone to be erased after 10 failed login attempts. If that is the case, a tenth failed attempt will erase your device. If not, you will need to either restore or erase your device to access it again.</p><p> There are also some instances where you might not log into an iPhone or iPad for a long time and an older iOS version will disable the device.</p><p> While a disabled iPhone or iPad be annoying, there are several things you can do to get back in and start using your device again. They mostly involve erasing your device and restoring the latest backup.</p><h2 id="Restore-a-Disabled-iPhone-or-iPad-Backup-With-a-Computer"><a href="#Restore-a-Disabled-iPhone-or-iPad-Backup-With-a-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Restore a Disabled iPhone or iPad Backup With a Computer"></a>Restore a Disabled iPhone or iPad Backup With a Computer</h2><p> One of the easiest ways to fix a disabled device is with Finder on a Mac (or iTunes on a Windows PC). If you use your iPhone or iPad with a computer frequently, you might have a backup on file and can quickly restore your device and get it running correctly again.</p><p> To restore your iPhone or iPad with a computer, simply connect your device to your computer using the USB cable. Then open up Finder or iTunes and you will see your device in the sidebar or upper left-hand corner.

Some users will also only see a<strong>Restore iPhone</strong> or<strong>Restore iPad</strong> option if they don’t have a backup on file.</p><p> If you don’t have a backup on file on your computer, there are other places you might have a backup, like on iCloud.

This should be tried last, as it will erase everything on your iPhone and you won’t be able to get anything back.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restart-iphone-recovery-mode/" >How to Force Restart an iPhone and Enter Recovery Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Recovery Mode is essentially a way to erase your iPhone and start over. You will need a computer to do this.</p><p> First, you will need to plug your device into your computer with a USB cable and open Finder or iTunes on your computer. Once this is done, depending on your device, there are three ways to force your device to enter Recovery Mode.</p><p><strong>If your iPhone or iPad has a Home button</strong> , hold the power and Home button simultaneously. Do not let go of the buttons. Your device will shut off or turn back on, and you will see the Apple logo and, eventually, your device will enter Recovery Mode. When this happens, you will see a computer icon on your device, at which point you can let go.</p><p><strong>If you have an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus,</strong> you need to hold down the power button and both volume buttons at the same time. Once you see the Apple logo, keep holding these buttons and your device will enter Recovery Mode. You will be notified with a computer icon on the screen that will indicate the device is in Recovery Mode, at which point you can let go.</p><p><strong>For all other devices (including iPads)</strong> , to enter Recovery Mode, you need to press the volume up button, followed by the volume down button, and then hold the Side or Top button until the device enters Recovery Mode. Remember to keep holding the button when the logo appears. Just like with earlier models, you will see a computer icon, indicating that your device is in recovery mode. Once this appears, you can let go.</p><p> Please remember that the device must be plugged in for this to work. Some users might also get a notification saying that a device has been detected but could not be identified. If this comes up, keep holding the button, and eventually it will enter Recovery Mode.</p><p> Once your device is in Recovery Mode, it will appear on your computer and you will get a notification saying that there is a problem with the device and it needs to be updated or restored.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iphone-recovery-mode.png"                      alt="iphone recovery mode"                ></p><p> When this appears, hit<strong>Restore</strong> and your device will be wiped.

While it can be difficult for Apple to assist in these cases, Apple does offer this support link for these very instances and rarely can help you recover your device if you can prove you own it.</p><p> This option usually only works for those who purchased an iPhone directly from Apple, but it is worth a try.</p><h2 id="Preventing-Future-Issues"><a href="#Preventing-Future-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Preventing Future Issues"></a>Preventing Future Issues</h2><p> The simplest way to prevent your iPad or iPhone from becoming disabled is by using a password that is easy to remember. Also, take advantage of other security features such as Touch ID or Face ID to make it easy to unlock your phone.</p><p> If you’re finding that your device is frequently becoming disabled in a pocket or backpack, consider turning on Auto-Lock. With Auto-Lock on, your device screen will lock after 30 seconds, and previously entered digits on the pin pad will be erased.</p><p> By using iCloud, you can back up your device frequently and prevent having to lose everything when you do need to reset your device. This is very simple to set up. Open the<strong>Settings</strong> and at the very top, you can sign in to iCloud using your Apple ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/icloud-backups.PNG"                      alt="icloud backups"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szUqw4TLvWs?si=srv1OeLOe579gLwj&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/icloud-setting.jpg"                      alt="icloud setting"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If you already have an Apple ID, be sure to head to the iCloud settings to make sure Photos and iCloud Backup are on.</p><p> You can also set up your device to be erased after 10 failed login attempts.

With so many spam calls going out these days, the only way to know if an important call comes through without answering it is to send it to voicemail.</p><p> If you aren’t getting voicemails on your iPhone or the Phone app doesn’t seem to be working properly, there are a few fixes you can try. Hopefully, one of these fixes will get your iPhone’s voicemail working again, and you won’t miss any more messages in the future.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Empty-Your-Voicemail-Box"><a href="#1-Empty-Your-Voicemail-Box" class="headerlink" title="1.

While most modern iPhones have plenty of space, voicemail storage is limited and can fill up quickly, especially if you get a lot of spam calls.</p><p> To delete previous voicemails and make more space, head to the<strong>Phone</strong> app and tap<strong>Voicemail</strong> . Once here, tap<strong>Edit</strong> in the top right-hand corner and select the voicemails you want to delete.</p><p> Once selected, tap<strong>Delete</strong> in the bottom right-hand corner. Be sure to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/back-up-iphone-voicemails/" >back up your voicemails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you might need them in the future. This will free up space, and you should be able to receive voicemails again if this was the issue.</p><p> If you haven’t set up voicemail yet, that could also be your problem.

This doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it means that updating it will fix many carrier problems. This includes not getting voicemails on your iPhone.</p><p> Thankfully, updating your carrier settings is easy. Head to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; About</strong> to view your carrier settings. Wait for a few seconds; if your carrier requests an update, you’ll get a pop-up to install a carrier settings update.</p><p> It’s important to note that you should be careful with your carrier settings. This page contains information that should be kept private to avoid it getting into the wrong hands. Only share this information with your carrier or Apple.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2MlLvGxMwI?si=q_blGjXyJrGtzT8d&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Turn-Cellular-Service-Off-and-On-Again"><a href="#3-Turn-Cellular-Service-Off-and-On-Again" class="headerlink" title="3.

This is especially true if your voicemails aren’t downloading fast enough. One good indicator of this is getting a voicemail notification hours after you received a missed call from the same number. To resolve this issue, turn your cellular service off and on again.</p><p> You can do this by turning your phone off and on again, or you can put your phone in and out of airplane mode. Once you do this, check to see if your voicemail is working again by calling your phone from another device. If you received a voicemail, then this solved the problem.</p><p> Additionally, we’d like to point out that connecting to Wi-Fi can also sometimes help you resolve this problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wiIVztRIqQ?si=GBgdwQ78k5hbeFDv&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Make-Sure-Cellular-Data-Is-On"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-Cellular-Data-Is-On" class="headerlink" title="4.

After all, voicemail is a carrier feature, and connecting to data ensures that your voicemails get delivered. Cellular data is also necessary for the Visual Voicemail feature to work. This is where you can read a voicemail without listening to it.</p><p> If your voicemail isn’t working and you don’t have data turned on, enabling it could resolve the issue. Head to<strong>Settings &gt; Cellular</strong> and tap<strong>Cellular Data</strong> to turn it on. If you’re on a limited data plan, there are options to <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/everything-can-cut-iphone-cellular-data-usage" >reduce your iPhone’s data usage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and still receive voicemails.</p><h2 id="5-Enable-Wi-Fi-Calling"><a href="#5-Enable-Wi-Fi-Calling" class="headerlink" title="5.

A poor connection can also lead to getting missed call notifications without your phone ringing.</p><p> If this happens to you, you can resolve this by enabling <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/wi-fi-calling-iphone-guide/" >Wi-Fi calling on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This gives you a better connection and helps voicemails download quicker. It also helps you get better audio quality and reduces dropped calls.</p><p> To enable Wi-Fi calling, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Wi-Fi Calling</strong> . Once here, tap<strong>Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone</strong> to turn it on. This will enable Wi-Fi calling whenever you’re connected to Wi-Fi. It costs nothing, so it’s worth having it turned on 24&#x2F;7.</p><h2 id="6-Make-Sure-Call-Forwarding-Is-Off"><a href="#6-Make-Sure-Call-Forwarding-Is-Off" class="headerlink" title="6.

While disabled by default, sometimes it can accidentally get enabled if you’re playing around with the settings. If it’s enabled, this is why you aren’t receiving voicemails.</p><p> To disable it, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Call Forwarding</strong> and toggle it off. Not all carriers have Call Forwarding enabled. So, if you don’t see it in your iPhone settings, it means you don’t have it, or your carrier has disabled it.</p><p> This might be your issue if your iPhone is issued by your workplace, as many workplaces will set up Call Forwarding.</p><h2 id="7-Reset-Network-Settings"><a href="#7-Reset-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="7.

Access Your Voicemail the Old-Fashioned Way</h2><p> Visual Voicemail in the Phone app is great, but if it’s not working, it’s not the only way to check your voicemail.

It comes pre-installed on almost every Apple device, and it’s designed to be fast and efficient for them. However, there are times when Safari doesn’t work.</p><p> When this happens, it usually means there’s a setting or software issue. There are even cases where you might not be able to access the internet at all on your iPhone or iPad. Luckily, there are a variety of things you can try to get Safari working again.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your Device"></a>1. Restart Your Device</h2><p> You hear it all the time—turn your device off and on again. While this may sound too simple to work, restarting your iPhone or iPad has been known to clear your usable memory, which can speed up Safari.</p><p> If Safari is frozen or just a blank white screen, restarting your iPhone or iPad can also fix these problems. Before you try anything else, just make sure you cover the basics.</p><p> If you’re new to Safari or Apple devices, you might want to check out our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/safari-beginners-guide-iphone/" >beginner’s guide to Safari for iPhone and iPad users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=heERQcpMi77lqToE&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Turn-Off-Safari-Suggestions"><a href="#2-Turn-Off-Safari-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn Off Safari Suggestions"></a>2. Turn Off Safari Suggestions</h2><p> Turning off Safari Suggestions is one of the simplest and most common fixes for Safari not loading or crashing on an Apple device. While we aren’t sure why this works, many users have reported that turning this off fixes the problem.</p><p> To turn off suggestions, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari Suggestions</strong> and turn this off. You can also turn off<strong>Search Engine Suggestions</strong> while you’re there too, as some users reported this also fixes the issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/safari-suggestions.jpg"                      alt="safari suggestions"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pejPLJBLmXw?si=WD97jA3doqbMCkCX&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Some users have also said that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/allow-or-block-browser-pop-ups-on-iphone/" >blocking Safari popups on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can improve the memory usage of Safari. So, you may also want to give this a try.</p><p> If this fixes your issue, then you’re all set. If not, try the following steps.</p><h2 id="3-Turn-On-Cellular-Data-for-Safari"><a href="#3-Turn-On-Cellular-Data-for-Safari" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn On Cellular Data for Safari"></a>3. Turn On Cellular Data for Safari</h2><p> If you’re frequently connected to Wi-Fi, you may have cellular data off for Safari to save internet data. While helpful, if your Wi-Fi isn’t functioning right, connecting to cellular data could fix your issue.</p><p> To do this, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Cellular</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari</strong> and turn this on. If it was off, this was most likely the cause of your issue. Alternatively, you can turn off Wi-Fi if you’re connected and just connect with cellular data. If you can connect this way, that means there’s a network issue with your Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/safari-cellular-data.jpg"                      alt="safari cellular data"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoMiYpYiFZs?si=qvYvGytDD17fvSXO&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdpTAZ9zonQ?si=5Nd5SPW1axA7GPuB&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Edit-Your-Screen-Time-Settings"><a href="#4-Edit-Your-Screen-Time-Settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit Your Screen Time Settings"></a>4. Edit Your Screen Time Settings</h2><p> If you’ve ever changed your Screen Time settings or blocked certain websites through Screen Time, try turning these settings off. To block websites, you need to enable<strong>Content Restrictions</strong> which can inadvertently block websites you still want to use. If you can’t load a link from an email or text message, this could also be a sign that content restrictions are on.</p><p> To fix this issue, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Screen Time</strong> &gt;<strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong> and turn this option off. If it was on, then this was most likely your issue. If it was off already, proceed to the next fix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/screentime-content-privacy.jpg"                      alt="screentime content privacy"                ></p><h2 id="5-Clear-All-Safari’s-Data"><a href="#5-Clear-All-Safari’s-Data" class="headerlink" title="5. Clear All Safari’s Data"></a>5. Clear All Safari’s Data</h2><p> If you frequently use Safari, you might have a lot of data stored within the app, making it fail to load correctly. This is especially true if you’re using an iPhone or iPad with a lower storage capacity. If you get low storage notifications, this fix could resolve your issue.</p><p> To clear Safari’s data, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Safari</strong> &gt;<strong>Clear History and Website Data</strong> . This will erase all extra data in the Safari app. Some users report this works, but you’ll need to do it often if you can’t eliminate storage space elsewhere on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/clear-safari-history.jpg"                      alt="clear safari history"                ></p><h2 id="6-Update-iOS-to-the-Latest-Version"><a href="#6-Update-iOS-to-the-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="6. Update iOS to the Latest Version"></a>6. Update iOS to the Latest Version</h2><p> Some users have reported that updating iOS resolves issues with Safari. Whether Safari isn’t loading, is crashing, or just isn’t connecting to websites, try <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-you-need-to-update-ios/" >updating iOS on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Apple does a great job of fixing widespread issues with iOS updates. So, if there is an issue that Apple is aware of, it could get fixed by a subsequent update.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASUEYpqSP5E?si=0KOZxrTVexTuUkRn&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Reset-Your-Network-Settings"><a href="#7-Reset-Your-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="7. Reset Your Network Settings"></a>7. Reset Your Network Settings</h2><p> If you’ve had issues with your network before, like not getting service or pages timing out, resetting your Network Settings could help.</p><p> To reset the Network Settings on your iPhone or iPad, head to<strong>Settings &gt; General</strong> &gt;<strong>Transfer or Reset iPhone (iPad)</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> . This will reset only your Network Settings and won’t erase any other data on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reset-network-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="reset iphone network settings"                ></p><p> After you finish this, try opening Safari to see if it’s working again. If not, proceed to the next fix.</p><h2 id="8-Reset-to-Factory-Default-Settings"><a href="#8-Reset-to-Factory-Default-Settings" class="headerlink" title="8. Reset to Factory Default Settings"></a>8. Reset to Factory Default Settings</h2><p> If all else fails, you can try resetting your iPhone to the default settings. This will erase all the data on your iPhone, and you’ll have to set it up from scratch. However, this is also a very effective way to resolve all kinds of software problems. To do this, head to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>General</strong> &gt;<strong>Transfer or Reset iPhone (iPad)</strong> &gt;<strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/erase-all-content-1.jpg"                      alt="erase all content and settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmTJlcwgyrQ?si=x3hba82M0tT57fj7&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> After resetting to the default settings, test out the Safari app before you install your usual apps. If Safari is working then but stops working when a certain app is installed, that means the app installed is interfering with Safari.</p><p> If Safari isn’t working when you have a fresh install, make sure you didn’t <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restore-iphone-ipad-from-backup/" >restore a backup of your iPhone or iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you restored a backup, there could be something interfering with Safari that transferred over. If you reset your device without a backup and Safari still doesn’t work, you can try one of the two last troubleshooting steps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXmwwSmYqq4?si=Bb-eJfLnlpeeClyt&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Turn-On-JavaScript"><a href="#9-Turn-On-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="9.

However, if you’re having issues with Safari, it’s likely that JavaScript is off. Sometimes, one might turn JavsScript off as some websites might not support it.</p><p> If you’ve turned JavaScript off or want to check if it’s off and turn it back on, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Advanced</strong> on your iOS or iPadOS device.</p><h2 id="10-Use-an-Alternative-Browser"><a href="#10-Use-an-Alternative-Browser" class="headerlink" title="10.

Until then, you can try using an alternative browser to access the internet on your device. There are many great browsers available in the App Store that can cater to your needs.</p><p> Be sure to check back for iOS updates and see if Apple has addressed the bug. You can also start a new discussion in the <a class="link"   href="https://discussions.apple.com/welcome" >Apple Discussions Community <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see if anyone else is experiencing the same issue.</p><h2 id="Safari-Not-Working-on-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-It’s-Most-Likely-a-Software-Issue"><a href="#Safari-Not-Working-on-Your-iPhone-or-iPad-It’s-Most-Likely-a-Software-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Safari Not Working on Your iPhone or iPad?

It’s Most Likely a Software Issue</h2><p> Cracked screens and broken buttons are easy to diagnose as we can instantly see what’s wrong. But when Safari or other apps on your iPhone stop working, that usually means a software issue is at play.</p><p> You can usually fix these issues by updating iOS, changing your settings, or resetting your device. However, if the issue still isn’t fixed after trying everything above, you might need to post in the Apple forum about your issue for more help.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevating-channel-excellence-with-ideas-and-vision/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevating Channel Excellence with Ideas & Vision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhancing-engagement-a-guide-to-popular-tiktok-unboxers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Enhancing Engagement A Guide to Popular TikTok Unboxers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/11-easy-to-produce-vlog-projects-at-home-for-2024/"><u>11 Easy-to-Produce Vlog Projects at Home for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-boost-your-imagery-title-placement-techniques-on-video-clips-with-photos/"><u>2024 Approved Boost Your Imagery Title Placement Techniques on Video Clips with Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/clearing-up-the-confusion-a-guide-to-reactivating-icloud-settings-on-apples-mobile-gadgets/"><u>Clearing Up the Confusion: A Guide to Reactivating iCloud Settings on Apple's Mobile Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/get-swift-browsing-speedy-solutions-for-lagging-safari-apps-on-the-iphone/"><u>Get Swift Browsing: Speedy Solutions for Lagging Safari Apps on the iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-broken-video-files-of-huawei-mate-60-on-windows-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Repair Broken video files of Huawei Mate 60 on Windows??</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-motorola-moto-g73-5g-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Motorola Moto G73 5G PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-apple-id-and-apple-password-on-apple-iphone-se-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset Apple ID and Apple Password On Apple iPhone SE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-through-chatgpt-access-roadblocks/"><u>Navigating Through ChatGPT Access Roadblocks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/no-more-missing-messages-a-step-by-step-guide-to-fix-iphones-not-receiving-texts-from-android-phones/"><u>No More Missing Messages: A Step-by-Step Guide to Fix iPhones Not Receiving Texts From Android Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/revamping-response-time-accelerate-safari-performance-on-iphone/"><u>Revamping Response Time: Accelerate Safari Performance on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/score-a-steal-save-on-hp-victus-15-at-just-515-during-amazon-prime-day-shop-now/"><u>Score a Steal: Save on HP Victus 15 at Just $515 During Amazon Prime Day – Shop Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-a-malfunctioning-iphone-display-essential-tips-and-solutions/"><u>Troubleshooting a Malfunctioning iPhone Display: Essential Tips and Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-tips-resolving-iphone-email-sync-problems-today/"><u>Troubleshooting Tips: Resolving iPhone Email Sync Problems Today!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A Detailed Walkthrough for Tracking Down Lost Software</h2><p> Are you trying to open an app on your iPhone but can’t find it anywhere? It can be worrying if it’s a vital app you use for finance, productivity, or work.</p><p> Sometimes, we may intentionally hide an app, forget about it, and then struggle to locate it when needed, whereas other times, the app seems to have disappeared from the Home Screen of your iPhone.</p><p> Whatever the case, if you can’t unhide apps or notice that some apps are missing from your iPhone’s Home Screen, here’s how to find them.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><h2 id="1-Find-Your-App-in-the-App-Library"><a href="#1-Find-Your-App-in-the-App-Library" class="headerlink" title="1. Find Your App in the App Library"></a>1. Find Your App in the App Library</h2><p> If an app is installed on your iPhone but not on your Home Screen, it’s probably in the App Library, which places all your apps in proper categories. Swipe left on the last<strong>Home Screen</strong> page to reach<strong>App Library</strong> . Then, use the<strong>Search</strong> box to find your missing app quickly.</p><p> Once you find the app you’re looking for, long-press its app icon in the App Library, and if this app isn’t on the Home Screen, you will see an option to<strong>Add to Home Screen</strong> . Alternatively, you can drag it left from the App Library onto the Home Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/app-library-on-iphone-showing-all-apps-in-proper-categories.png"                      alt="App Library on iPhone showing all apps in proper categories"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/app-library-showing-apps-in-alphabetical-order.png"                      alt="App Library showing apps in alphabetical order"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/long-press-app-in-app-library-and-tap-add-to-home-screen.png"                      alt="Long-press app in App Library and tap Add to Home Screen"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> In the future, if you want all the new apps you download to show on the iPhone Home Screen, open<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Home Screen</strong> and select<strong>Add to Home Screen</strong> . This will put an end to new apps not appearing on the Home Screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_69vX9wnRE?si=FtLxkpRhPORqcMeE&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Use-Spotlight-to-Find-the-Missing-App"><a href="#2-Use-Spotlight-to-Find-the-Missing-App" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Spotlight to Find the Missing App"></a>2. Use Spotlight to Find the Missing App</h2><p> The second method is to use Spotlight search, which helps you find files and apps stored anywhere on your device.</p><p> If your iPhone is updated to iOS 16 or later, just tap the<strong>Search</strong> button above the<strong>Dock</strong> to access this feature. If not, swipe down on the center of your Home Screen to bring up Spotlight search.</p><p> Now, type the app name to find it. Once you do, you can also long-press the app icon and select the<strong>Add to Home Screen</strong> option or manually drag it onto the Home Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_5638.jpg"                      alt="iphone home screen"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_5639.jpg"                      alt="iphone search screen"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/img_5640.jpg"                      alt="use search to find an app in iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmj7aVvEeAs?si=OcR7USXKGyLcn09q&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-Ask-Siri-to-Open-the-Missing-App"><a href="#3-Ask-Siri-to-Open-the-Missing-App" class="headerlink" title="3.

Besides opening apps, there are many other <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/8-things-you-probably-didnt-realize-siri-could-do/" >tasks you can ask Siri to carry out for you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="4-Look-Inside-Folders-to-Find-Hidden-Apps"><a href="#4-Look-Inside-Folders-to-Find-Hidden-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Look Inside Folders to Find Hidden Apps"></a>4. Look Inside Folders to Find Hidden Apps</h2><p> Sometimes we put apps inside folders to hide them or keep them away from plain sight in case those apps aren’t used frequently. After a while, it’s possible to forget about them.</p><p> If this is your situation, open all the app folders on your iPhone Home Screen and look for the missing app inside. Once you find it, you may want to drag the app icon out of the folder onto the Home Screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L603QXgjb3I?si=sMYHfMGy2kNPSHPt&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Check-Screen-Time-to-Unhide-Restricted-Apps"><a href="#5-Check-Screen-Time-to-Unhide-Restricted-Apps" class="headerlink" title="5.

Check Screen Time to Unhide Restricted Apps</h2><p> You can use Screen Time to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hide-restrict-apps-iphone/" >hide and restrict iPhone apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Safari, Camera, FaceTime, Mail, and more. As a result, you won’t find the app icons for these restricted apps on the Home Screen or the App Library. They won’t even appear in Spotlight search results or be accessible via Siri.</p><p> To unhide these apps, open<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Screen Time</strong> &gt;<strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong> &gt;<strong>Allowed Apps</strong> and ensure all the apps are allowed. Next, tap<strong>Back</strong> , go to<strong>Content Restrictions</strong> &gt;<strong>Apps</strong> , and select<strong>Allow All Apps</strong> . Alternatively, you can also <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/turn-off-screen-time/" >turn off Screen Time on your iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to remove all the restrictions at once.</p><p> After doing this, you should see the missing app icons on the Home Screen and App Library. If not, you’ll have to use the Spotlight search method explained above to re-add them to the Home Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-content--privacy-restrictions-in-iphone-screen-time-settings.png"                      alt="Tap Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions in iPhone Screen Time Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKRBWf1EDZo?si=CTNd4q450biit4eM&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-allowed-apps-in-iphone-screen-time-settings.png"                      alt="Tap Allowed Apps in iPhone Screen Time Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0Ww1YIIUe4?si=cQ-Gkh9UCJABuPZU&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/make-sure-all-iphone-apps-are-allowed-and-nothing-is-restricted.png"                      alt="Make Sure all iPhone apps are allowed and nothing is restricted"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hS27nZVi9Y?si=_Zqj_l4a4XkPqT2S&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="6-Unhide-Home-Screen-Pages-to-See-All-Your-Apps"><a href="#6-Unhide-Home-Screen-Pages-to-See-All-Your-Apps" class="headerlink" title="6.

Unhide Home Screen Pages to See All Your Apps</h2><p> iOS allows you to hide Home Screen pages for a cleaner look, but if you did that accidentally, you might get confused, wondering where your installed apps have gone.</p><p> Worry not! If you want to continue retaining a minimalist Home Screen, you can access the downloaded apps in the App Library or restore your Home Screen pages by unhiding them.</p><p> To avoid confusion in the future, learn more about <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/hide-iphone-home-screen-pages/" >hiding and unhiding the Home Screen pages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Use-App-Store-to-Check-If-an-App-Is-Installed-or-Not"><a href="#7-Use-App-Store-to-Check-If-an-App-Is-Installed-or-Not" class="headerlink" title="7.

Reset the Home Screen Layout to View All Apps Alphabetically</h2><p> If you want every app listed alphabetically to be sure not to miss anything, you can reset the Home Screen and Dock layout. After this, the Home Screen will show all the Apple apps (just like a new iPhone). And the apps you have downloaded will be placed alphabetically in order.</p><p>Here’s how to reset your iPhone’s Home Screen layout:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> and tap<strong>General</strong> .</li><li>Scroll to the bottom and tap<strong>Transfer or Reset iPhone</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset Home Screen Layout</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-general-in-iphone-settings-app.png"                      alt="Tap General in iPhone Settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/from-the-bottom-tap-reset-in-iphone-settings.png"                      alt="From the bottom tap Reset in iPhone Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-reset-home-screen-layout-in-iphone-settings.png"                      alt="Tap Reset Home Screen Layout in iPhone Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCpzYpVPIZA?si=hNte-mPRIzjvqpRy&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="9-Additional-Fixes-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-an-App"><a href="#9-Additional-Fixes-if-You-Still-Can’t-Find-an-App" class="headerlink" title="9.

Additional Fixes if You Still Can’t Find an App</h2><p> Most of the methods we covered above involve unhiding an app and getting it back on the Home Screen again. But if those don’t work, an app disappearing may be caused by a glitch.</p><p> In this case, you can use generic (but frequently effective) solutions such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restarting your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You should also update your iPhone to ensure your device receives bug fixes from the latest version of iOS. Go to<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong> to check if an iOS update is available.</p><h2 id="Hopefully-You-Found-the-Missing-iPhone-App"><a href="#Hopefully-You-Found-the-Missing-iPhone-App" class="headerlink" title="Hopefully, You Found the Missing iPhone App"></a>Hopefully, You Found the Missing iPhone App</h2><p> These were the quick ways to find any missing or hidden apps on iPhone. Sometimes if you can’t find an app, you likely deleted it. In this case, re-download it from the App Store.</p><p> Additionally, it’s possible that the app was removed from the App Store by the developer or Apple (as was the case with Flappy Bird and Fortnite, respectively). In such situations, you will have to use one of its alternatives.</p><p> If it’s often difficult to find apps or open them quickly, it might be worth allocating some time to organize your iPhone’s Home Screen layout to help with that.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-comprehensive-guide-screenflow-pro-on-macos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Comprehensive Guide ScreenFlow Pro on macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-practical-steps-for-immediate-deletion-on-youtube-platform/"><u>[New] Practical Steps for Immediate Deletion on Youtube Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-superior-soundtracks-compilation-for-vids/"><u>[Updated] Superior Soundtracks Compilation for Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-achieving-professional-grade-vr-gameplay-captures/"><u>2024 Approved Achieving Professional-Grade VR Gameplay Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-online-image-enhancement-melodic-twist/"><u>2024 Approved Online Image Enhancement Melodic Twist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-prime-video-recording-devices-top-10/"><u>2024 Approved The Prime Video Recording Devices Top 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721447843063-6-common-problems-with-iphones-look-up-functionality-solutions-inside/"><u>6 Common Problems with iPhone's Look Up Functionality – Solutions Inside!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721475280220-cant-connect-iphone-with-itunesfinder-try-these-proven-fixing-tips/"><u>Can't Connect iPhone with iTunes/Finder?

However, there are instances when some or all of your contact names don’t show up on your iPhone.</p><p> If contacts aren’t showing up on your iPhone, you can use this guide as a fix. But before we dive into the different options, remember that various problems can make your iPhone contacts disappear.</p><p> And therefore, there are various solutions that you can use to fix it. So, try each of these methods and see which one helps to restore contacts on your iPhone.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your iPhone"></a>1. Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> One of the first steps you should try is restarting your iPhone. Sometimes when mobile devices run for a while, they may run into issues. Restarting your iPhone will help give it a fresh start and thus may help fix minor issues you’re facing, including contacts not showing up, sluggish performance, app crashes, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/f4c650853e8507f493dd5a4da625f53ce5ecb8f26fcbb71888c8a6af3708b00c.jpg"                      alt="Person using iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KXVWj6Ar1M?si=Cd_jktmoN3e9OzH3&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-restarting-smartphone-fixes-most-problems/" >Restarting can fix most smartphone problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and that’s why the first question a tech support agent asks is, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?”</p><p> There are different ways to restart your iPhone, depending on the model.

Once your iPhone is back up and running, confirm if your contacts have been restored.

Resync Your Contacts With iCloud</h2><p> You could also fix this issue by resyncing your Contacts app with iCloud. We’ll do this by disabling iCloud access to Contacts and then re-enabling it again. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> and tap on your name.</li><li>Next, select<strong>iCloud &gt; Show All</strong> .</li><li>Under the Apps using iCloud page, toggle off<strong>Contacts</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Keep on My iPhone</strong> to save copies of synced contacts to your iPhone. You can also select<strong>Delete from My iPhone</strong> if you want. Don’t worry; this option doesn’t make your contacts disappear.</li><li>Re-enable<strong>Contacts</strong> again. And if your iPhone asks to merge existing contacts, select<strong>Merge</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Settings-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icloud-page-ios-16.jpg"                      alt="iCloud settings in iOS 16"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disabling-contacts-sync-ios-16.jpg"                      alt="Disabling Contacts sync in iOS 16"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> After that, give your device a few minutes, then check to see if your contacts have been restored.

Show All Contacts in Your Phone App"></a>3. Show All Contacts in Your Phone App</h2><p> Your iPhone contacts might not show up because you have hidden some of them. You may not know this, but your iPhone usually places your contacts in groups based on your connected accounts. To see all your contacts, no matter their group, you need to ensure all groups are visible.</p><p>So, follow these steps to show hidden contact groups:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Phone</strong> app and tap the<strong>Contacts</strong> tab.</li><li>Tap<strong>Lists</strong> in the top left.</li><li>On the<strong>Lists</strong> page, tap<strong>All Contacts</strong> at the top to view all your saved contacts.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/contacts-app-ios-16.jpg"                      alt="Contacts app in iOS 16"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/accounts-options-contacts-app.jpg"                      alt="All Accounts option in iOS 16"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-COuhPT5mk?si=wLZU6jkkAdJuAn6h&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> If some contacts from a particular account weren’t showing up on your iPhone, this should fix the issue.

Add All Your Accounts to Your iPhone"></a>4. Add All Your Accounts to Your iPhone</h2><p> If you have several accounts that you use, chances are contacts might be saved across them. To fix this, you need to add all your accounts to your iPhone to ensure you have access to all your contacts. So, follow these steps to add an account to your iPhone:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> , then scroll down and select<strong>Contacts</strong> .</li><li>Now, tap<strong>Accounts</strong> . You’ll see all accounts that are currently added to your iPhone.</li><li>Tap<strong>Add Account</strong> , select the type of account, and log in using your credentials.</li><li>After successful login, the account will appear under<strong>Settings &gt; Contacts &gt; Accounts</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01-contacts-settings-ios.jpg"                      alt="Contacts settings page in iOS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-ssCD10v2M?si=WVWGNayUiCAkMZzZ&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/02-accounts-ios-settings.jpg"                      alt="Accounts page in iOS settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/03-add-account-ios.jpg"                      alt="Adding a new account in iOS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKjioJQaUh8?si=Ls_AeuvGsSyL5ny2&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> If you don’t see any contacts from the newly added account, follow the steps in the next tip to ensure contact visibility.</p><h2 id="5-Modify-Your-Contact-Account-Settings"><a href="#5-Modify-Your-Contact-Account-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Modify Your Contact Account Settings"></a>5. Modify Your Contact Account Settings</h2><p> Your<strong>Accounts</strong> settings also affect the visibility of your contacts. You need to ensure that all your connected accounts have Contacts sync enabled. To do this, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Launch<strong>Settings &gt; Contacts</strong> .</li><li>Under Contacts, select<strong>Accounts</strong> . You will see all your connected accounts listed here.</li><li>Tap each account and ensure<strong>Contacts</strong> is toggled on.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iOS-Settings-app.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of iOS Settings app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contacts-option-in-iOS-settings-app.jpg"                      alt="Contacts settings in iOS"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Individual-account-settings-iOS.jpg"                      alt="Individual account settings in iOS"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If contacts from one of your connected accounts weren’t showing up on your iPhone, this should help fix the issue.</p><p> Additionally, you can try disabling and enabling Short Name on your iPhone. While this feature is handy to ensure more names fit on the screen, it can sometimes be problematic. To do this, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Contacts &gt; Short Name</strong> . Disable<strong>Short Name</strong> , then wait for some time and turn it on.</p><h2 id="6-Rebuild-Your-iPhone-Contacts"><a href="#6-Rebuild-Your-iPhone-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="6. Rebuild Your iPhone Contacts"></a>6. Rebuild Your iPhone Contacts</h2><p> Another way to troubleshoot iPhone contacts not showing up is by force rebuilding them. To do this, you’ll have to edit one of your contacts first, then restart your iPhone. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>First, select any visible contact from the<strong>Phone</strong> app and select<strong>Edit</strong> in the top right.</li><li>Add some new details—they don’t have to be accurate. You can add a fake email, address, note, or anything.</li><li>Once done, tap<strong>Done</strong> in the top right and then restart your iPhone.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/01-edit-iphone-contact.jpg"                      alt="Editing contact details on iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/02-editing-contact-details-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Editing contact details on iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2cXnI9oOvM?si=3nz2sBB124ln-83T&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/edited-contact-ios.jpg"                      alt="An edited contact on iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLb1ViO4WR8?si=g_aiHGNCd7eAvmDM&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> When your iPhone powers on, it will have to rebuild all the contact names and details. Once your iPhone restores all the contacts, you can delete the fake information you added to the contact above. Check if your contacts have been restored after a few minutes. If this doesn’t solve your issue, try data recovery tools.</p><h2 id="7-Recover-Lost-Data-Using-iCloud-or-Data-Recovery-Tools"><a href="#7-Recover-Lost-Data-Using-iCloud-or-Data-Recovery-Tools" class="headerlink" title="7.

Next, select<strong>Restore Contacts</strong> . You’ll then have to select an archive to restore.</p><p> You need to have an archive of your contacts that you can restore. If you’ve never archived your contacts in the past, there won’t be any to restore.</p><p> If that doesn’t work, you can try using third-party <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/data-recovery-work/" >data recovery tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to restore your contacts.

In summary, you could restart your iPhone, resync with iCloud, show all contacts in your Phone app, add all accounts to your iPhone, modify account settings, or force rebuild your contacts.</p><p> If none of these solutions work for you, you can try restoring lost contacts from your iCloud backups. If that fails, make sure to contact Apple’s support team. Using third-party data recovery tools should be your last resort, as you will certainly have to pay for it. Hopefully, one of the free methods works for you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-vimeos-revenue-revolution-strategies-for-sustainable-earnings/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Vimeo's Revenue Revolution Strategies for Sustainable Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-how-many-viewer-thumbs-up-equals-money-youtube-tips/"><u>[Updated] How Many Viewer Thumbs Up Equals Money?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elevate-Your-iPhone’s-Internet-Experience-with-These-8-Wi-Fi-Optimization-Tricks"><a href="#Elevate-Your-iPhone’s-Internet-Experience-with-These-8-Wi-Fi-Optimization-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Elevate Your iPhone’s Internet Experience with These 8 Wi-Fi Optimization Tricks"></a>Elevate Your iPhone’s Internet Experience with These 8 Wi-Fi Optimization Tricks</h2><p> A Wi-Fi connection is an essential function of any iPhone—but sometimes a poor signal interferes with surfing the web, using apps, or streaming. In these instances, you should look at ways to improve the Wi-Fi performance on your iPhone.</p><p> Let’s look at fixes that can help you when your iPhone’s Wi-Fi isn’t working properly.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your Router"></a>1. Restart Your Router</h2><p> This is an often-overlooked step, but sometimes restarting the router is all it takes to fix Wi-Fi problems on your iPhone—especially if other devices are having trouble. Restarting your router brings it back to a fresh state, clearing any temporary problems.</p><p> To restart your router, simply locate its physical power button and toggle it off and back on. Alternately, you can disconnect the power plug. Wait for a minute or so before switching it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/internet-router-in-living-room.png"                      alt="A white internet router sitting on a table"                ></p><p> If you reach the end of this guide and your iPhone’s Wi-Fi still hasn’t improved, the problem likely lies with your router. Follow our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-slow-unstable-wi-fi-connection/" >router speed troubleshooting guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more help; performing a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-router/" >complete router reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be necessary in extreme cases.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblaBc-v2vs?si=CKW1gJwXQT2vZJYo&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Experiment-With-Router-Placement"><a href="#2-Experiment-With-Router-Placement" class="headerlink" title="2. Experiment With Router Placement"></a>2. Experiment With Router Placement</h2><p> The average Wi-Fi signal has a range of about 150 feet indoors. A longer distance between your iPhone and the router results in a weaker signal, so <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-wireless-dead-zone-and-how-to-eliminate-it/" >consider moving your router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> closer to where you use your phone the most.</p><p> Wi-Fi signals can also get blocked by barricades, such as walls and floors. Try positioning the router in a place that’s within eyesight, clear from barriers. Having your router up higher helps avoid interference from furniture and similar.</p><p> To check the strength of your connection on an iPhone, look at the cone-shaped stripes at the top-left corner, which indicates Wi-Fi strength. Three bars mean the signal is strong, two bars are moderate, and one bar means it’s weak.</p><p> If you live around a lot of people, network congestion could also be an issue.

However, some can—these are usually metal cases. Metal disrupts the transmission from the antenna, which is located somewhere near the top of your iPhone, depending on the model.</p><p> If your phone case is metal-plated, swap it out for a silicone, plastic, or leather one instead. You should also avoid using metal rings or PopSockets that stick to the back of the phone.</p><h2 id="4-Cut-Down-on-Network-Heavy-Activity"><a href="#4-Cut-Down-on-Network-Heavy-Activity" class="headerlink" title="4. Cut Down on Network-Heavy Activity"></a>4. Cut Down on Network-Heavy Activity</h2><p> Downloads, streaming, and certain apps can hog your available bandwidth. You should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-out-whos-eating-your-bandwidth-with-these-tips/" >check what’s using your bandwidth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to pinpoint any clear culprits. If this doesn’t turn anything up, you’re going to have to run each app or function individually, one at a time, to see which ones are affecting the Wi-Fi.</p><p> Thankfully, there are also a few ways to cut down the amount of bandwidth your iPhone uses. First, you can check which apps tend to gobble up the most bandwidth by viewing their data usage on your iPhone. Depending on when you last reset the statistics, however, this might not be very accurate.</p><p>To check data usage on your iPhone:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings &gt; Mobile Data</strong> .</li><li>Scroll through the list of apps in the current period and view their data usage right below the names.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/settings-mobile-data-iphone.png"                      alt="data usage information on iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/settings-mobile-data-iphone-1.png"                      alt="data usage information on iPhone"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Next, you can turn off automatic app updates to reduce bandwidth usage in the background:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings &gt; App Store</strong> .</li><li>Turn off<strong>App Updates</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iphone-settings-auto-downloads-off.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Settings - Auto Downloads Turned Off"                ></p><p>With this disabled, you’ll need to manually update apps instead:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>App Store</strong> app.</li><li>Select<strong>Apps</strong> at the bottom.</li><li>Tap your avatar at the top-right.</li><li>Choose<strong>Update</strong> next to each app under<strong>Available Updates</strong> .</li></ol><p> VPNs require additional bandwidth, so it might be worth turning that off at home if you use one.</p><p> Since streaming can put a lot of strain on your network, opt for downloading media (at non-peak times) over streaming wherever possible, especially media that you repeatedly consumed, such as music.

While the obvious step here is to take your iPhone to an Apple-authorized service provider, what if you want to mute your iPhone in the meantime?</p><p> Well, there are a couple of ways you can mute or unmute your iPhone when its Ring&#x2F;Silent switch is broken.

And this time, select<strong>Unmute</strong> under the<strong>Device</strong> options.</li></ul><p> Although this approach works fine, it involves multiple taps. As you can imagine, this won’t be very practical if you switch between Ring and Silent profiles on your iPhone multiple times a day.</p><p> So, a better approach would be to customize AssistiveTouch’s top-level menu and add the<strong>Mute</strong> option on the main screen. Or, to set up a custom action for AssistiveTouch to mute or unmute the device directly.</p><h3 id="1-Customize-the-Top-Level-Menu"><a href="#1-Customize-the-Top-Level-Menu" class="headerlink" title="1. Customize the Top Level Menu"></a>1. Customize the Top Level Menu</h3><p> AssistiveTouch features six buttons in its Top Level menu by default. However, you can customize the menu to add or remove buttons according to your requirements.</p><p> So, follow these steps to add a new (<strong>Mute</strong>) button to AssistiveTouch’s top-level menu:</p><ol><li>Go to the<strong>AssistiveTouch</strong> settings on your iPhone.</li><li>Tap on<strong>Customize Top Level Menu</strong> .</li><li>Hit the<strong>plus (+)</strong> button at the bottom.</li><li>Tap on the<strong>plus (+)</strong> icon in the layout and select the<strong>Mute</strong> system action.</li><li>Now, hit<strong>Done</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/customizing-assistivetouch-top-level-menu-1.jpg"                      alt="AssistiveTouch settings on iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/customizing-assistivetouch-top-level-menu-2.jpg"                      alt="customizing AssistiveTouch&#39;s top-level menu"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/customizing-assistivetouch-top-level-menu-3.jpg"                      alt="adding a new button to the AssistiveTouch menu"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/620kcQ7Dw7w?si=a5ussGs5HV7sG3hF&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/customizing-assistivetouch-top-level-menu-4.jpg"                      alt="selecting Mute action for the new AssistiveTouch button"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/customizing-assistivetouch-top-level-menu-5.jpg"                      alt="Mute action in AssistiveTouch&#39;s top-level menu"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> All you need to do now is tap the AssistiveTouch button and hit<strong>Mute</strong> . When you do this, the<strong>Mute</strong> button will change to<strong>Unmute</strong> , and you can tap on it again to unmute the device quickly.</p><h3 id="2-Set-Up-a-Custom-Action"><a href="#2-Set-Up-a-Custom-Action" class="headerlink" title="2. Set Up a Custom Action"></a>2. Set Up a Custom Action</h3><p> AssistiveTouch also supports executing custom actions using gestures. It has three customizable gestures:<strong>Single-Tap</strong> ,<strong>Double-Tap</strong> , and<strong>Long Press</strong> , and you can assign a wide range of actions to these gestures, including the mute action. By default, the Single-Tap gesture is set to the<strong>Open Menu</strong> action, so you’ll need to assign the Mute action to either Double-Tap or Long Press gestures.</p><p>Follow these simple instructions to get this done:</p><ol><li>Head over to the<strong>AssistiveTouch</strong> settings.</li><li>Depending on what gesture you want to use, tap on one under<strong>CUSTOM ACTIONS</strong> and select<strong>Mute</strong> from the list of actions.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/setting-a-custom-action-for-assistivetouch-button-1.jpg"                      alt="AssistiveTouch settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/setting-a-custom-action-for-assistivetouch-button-2.jpg"                      alt="adding Mute action to Double-Tap gesture"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Once set up, muting and unmuting your iPhone should be even easier. Simply perform the gesture to which you’ve assigned the Mute action, and it’ll mute the device. Repeat it again to unmute.</p><h2 id="Mute-or-Unmute-iPhone-Using-Back-Tap"><a href="#Mute-or-Unmute-iPhone-Using-Back-Tap" class="headerlink" title="Mute or Unmute iPhone Using Back Tap"></a>Mute or Unmute iPhone Using Back Tap</h2><p> AssistiveTouch used to be the only way to mute or unmute your iPhone when the Ring&#x2F;Silent switch stopped working for the longest time. And sure, it works fine and gets the job done, but for some, it isn’t aesthetically pleasing to have the button on the screen at all times.</p><p> Fortunately,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/secret-button-iphone-back-tap/" >the iPhone’s Back Tap feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> serves as a better AssitiveTouch alternative for muting or unmuting the iPhone. Here’s how to set it up:</p><ol><li>Launch<strong>Settings</strong> .</li><li>Go to<strong>Accessibility &gt; Touch</strong> , scroll down to the bottom of the page, and select<strong>Back Tap</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mute-unmute-iphone-using-back-tap-1.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Accessibility settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wiIVztRIqQ?si=GBgdwQ78k5hbeFDv&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mute-unmute-iphone-using-back-tap-2.jpg"                      alt="Back Tap feature under Touch Accessibility settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Once you’re in the Back Tap accessibility menu, you can choose a couple of options:</p><ol><li>Tap on<strong>Double Tap</strong> or<strong>Triple Tap</strong> , depending on the gesture you want to use.</li><li>Next, select<strong>Mute</strong> on the following screen.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mute-unmute-iphone-using-back-tap-3.jpg"                      alt="Back Tap gesture options"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mute-unmute-iphone-using-back-tap-4.jpg"                      alt="setting Mute action to a Back Tap gesture"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBCobAYzzcc?si=J3eSTQ3AdyxWAjGo&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> Now, whenever you want to mute your iPhone, simply perform the double-tap or triple-tap gesture on the back of your iPhone. To unmute it, perform the same gesture again.</p><p> With certain iPhone cases, especially thicker ones, you might need to tap harder for the iPhone to register your taps and trigger the action.</p><h2 id="Broken-iPhone-Ring-Silent-Switch-No-Problem"><a href="#Broken-iPhone-Ring-Silent-Switch-No-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Broken iPhone Ring&#x2F;Silent Switch? No Problem"></a>Broken iPhone Ring&#x2F;Silent Switch? No Problem</h2><p> A broken or malfunctioning Ring&#x2F;Silent switch can make things inconvenient. This can be particularly problematic if you frequently switch between Ring and Silent sound profiles on your iPhone.</p><p> Thankfully, AssistiveTouch and Back Tap features serve as workarounds to mute or unmute your iPhone easily and just about as conveniently as with the physical switch until you get it fixed. And while both of them get the job done, we recommend Back Tap since it isn’t obtrusive and acts like a physical button.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-capturing-moments-with-the-best-5-photo-and-video-apps-for-iphonesandroid/"><u>[New] Capturing Moments with the Best 5 Photo & Video Apps for iPhones/Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-profile-videos-a-guide-to-allure-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Profile Videos A Guide to Allure for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-share-igtv-videos-to-facebook-3-ways/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Share IGTV Videos to Facebook [3 Ways]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/15-best-strongest-pokemon-to-use-in-pokemon-go-pvp-leagues-for-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>15 Best Strongest Pokémon To Use in Pokémon GO PvP Leagues For Poco M6 Pro 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/discover-the-finest-apple-watch-offers-for-summer-2024-a-comprehensive-list-top-picks/"><u>Discover the Finest Apple Watch Offers for Summer 2024: A Comprehensive List Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/diy-solutions-for-an-unresponsive-proximity-sensor-on-your-ios-device/"><u>DIY Solutions for an Unresponsive Proximity Sensor on Your iOS Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/fixing-issues-how-to-make-civilization-vi-functional-on-windows-11/"><u>Fixing Issues: How to Make Civilization VI Functional on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-an-iphone-that-isnt-answering-calls-from-others/"><u>How to Fix an iPhone That Isn't Answering Calls From Others</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-seamless-setup-of-ifunny-meme-toolkit/"><u>In 2024, How-To Seamless Setup of iFunny Meme Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721479259932-iphone-rotation-issue-master-the-fix-for-landscape-display-now/"><u>IPhone Rotation Issue?
