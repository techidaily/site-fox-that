## Steps to Resolve Message Error Code MM when Setting Up New SIM

### Key Takeaways

* The "SIM not provisioned" error occurs when your SIM card is no longer able to share information between your cellphone and your provider. This can happen when you have a new phone with a new SIM card or when you're transferring contacts to a new SIM card.
* The "SIM not provisioned for voice" error means that you cannot make voice calls. This is usually caused by your line becoming disconnected from your carrier account.
* You may see an "eSIM not provisioned" error if you've switched from a physical SIM card to an eSIM.

 Swapping SIM cards and getting an error message on your phone? The "SIM not provisioned MM2" error is easy enough to fix, but what does it mean? Let's take a look at how to fix this SIM card error and ensure you can avoid it happening again in the future.

## What Does "SIM Not Provisioned" Mean?

 SIM cards contain certain information that helps with the identification of your cell phone account. The SIM enables the phone to be identified as yours on the mobile network ([thanks to the IMEI number](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/phones-imei-makeuseof-explains/) ). This enables you to make calls and connect to the mobile internet.

 To understand why your phone may be displaying a "SIM not provisioned" error message, it helps to know what the word "provisioned" means. Provision can be defined as the act of providing or supplying something. In the case of your SIM card, it is not provisioned if it is no longer able to share information between your cellphone and your provider.

 The "SIM not provisioned" error should only affect users who need to register a new SIM card. If it occurs at any other time, it can signify a problem with the SIM card, and you'll need to get a replacement.

 When the "SIM card not provisioned MM2" error appears, you can trace it back to one of the following:

* You bought a new phone with a new SIM card.
* You're transferring contacts to a new SIM card.
* Your mobile network provider's server is unavailable (if you're using an iPhone, the Apple server also needs to be online).
* There's a problem with the placement of the SIM card.

 Other SIM error messages might occur, depending on your situation. For instance, if the SIM card is locked to a particular phone, when you insert it into a new device you may see the "SIM not valid" message.[Unlocking the SIM](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sim-unlock-android-smartphone-tablet/) will let you use it in any compatible phone.

## What Is the "SIM Not Provisioned for Voice" Error?

 An error that is growing in frequency is "SIM not provisioned for voice." It commonly occurs on devices connected to the Google Fi network (a combination of mobile and Wi-Fi networks) and on Google Pixel devices. However, there are also instances where the "SIM not provisioned for voice" error is displaying on other carriers and smartphones.

### What Does "SIM Not Provisioned for Voice" Mean?

 In most cases, if your phone is displaying a "SIM not provisioned for voice" error message, then means that you cannot make voice calls. The most common reason for this is that your line has become disconnected from your carrier account. The steps below should help to resolve this.

## What Does "SIM 2 Not Provisioned" Error Mean?

 If the "SIM not provisioned" error specifies a number, then it is almost certainly because you're using a [dual-SIM phone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dual-sim-phones/) . Each slot is numbered, so you might see "SIM 1 not provisioned" and "SIM 2 not provisioned" errors.

 This isn't too much to worry about. It simply means that when you follow step four below, you carry out the process twice, for each SIM card.

 You can also see an "eSIM not provisioned" error. This will often happen when you switch from a physical SIM to an eSIM and the eSIM has not yet been activated. See step 4, below, for more on that.

## 7 Ways to Fix "SIM Not Provisioned" Errors

 Try these tricks to re-enable your SIM card and put an end to the "SIM not provisioned" errors on your Android phone.

### 1\. Update Carrier Services

 Like most things on your phone, communications between the device and mobile networks are controlled via an app.

 Carrier Services is a Google app that is preinstalled in Android and receives regular updates. If you have found that the "SIM card not provisioned MM#2" error has occurred without you having swapped to a new phone or inserted a new SIM, it could be down to a problem with Carrier Services.

To fix this:

1. Open the [Carrier Services](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU35531/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims) page on the Google Play Store.
2. If there's an**Update** button visible, tap it to update the app then see if that fixes the problem.

 If there isn't an update or it doesn't solve the problem, the cause of the error is something else.

### 2\. Enable and Disable Airplane Mode

 Perhaps the simplest of all potential "SIM not provisioned MM2" errors is to disable all connectivity on the phone or tablet.

 This is easily done thanks to Airplane Mode, a state that any mobile device can be switched into with a single tap. Enabling Airplane Mode disables connections to mobile internet and basic cellular networks; by subsequently disabling Airplane Mode, the aim is to re-establish a fresh connection to overcome the SIM not provisioned error.

To put Android into Airplane Mode:

1. Swipe down from the top of the screen with two fingers.
2. In the**Quick Settings** screen, tap**Airplane Mode** .
3. Wait for the change (just a few seconds).
4. When you're ready to undo, simply repeat steps 1-2.

![Enable Airplane mode Android 12](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/muo-android-sim-not-provisioned-airplane-1.jpg)

Close

 At that point, a fresh connection should be made with the mobile network. If the SIM is working properly, the "SIM not provisioned MM2" error should no longer appear.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Restart Your Phone

 It may seem unlikely, but simply turning off your phone can overcome the SIM not provisioned fault. Take the usual steps to restart the phone and wait. A few moments later you'll see that the error message no longer appears, and your SIM card is activated.

### 4\. Correctly Insert the SIM Card

![Replace your SIM card](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/muo-android-sim-not-provisioned-card.jpg)

 If the issue isn't with the SIM card's activation or the network, then it might simply be an ill-fitting SIM. This might be due to problems with the shape of the SIM itself or a badly designed SIM card slot (or caddy).

 To check if the SIM is correctly seated, switch off your phone, then find the SIM card:

* If you have an older, or cheaper phone, find the SIM card by opening the back panel. You may need to remove the battery to access the SIM card slot.
* With flagship phones or those without removable batteries, the SIM card slot is usually at the side of the handset. This is typically a caddy upon which the SIM card sits—you'll need a small SIM eject tool to open it. Look for a small hole along the side of your phone and push the tool in to eject the SIM.

 Be sure to remove the SIM card and not the microSD storage card, as they often share the same slot.

 Removing the SIM card can be tricky. You may need to use tweezers, or jimmy it out from underneath if a removable battery is involved. With the SIM card removed, give it a blow, and perhaps a quick dust with a lint-free cloth.

 Replace the cleaned SIM card, taking care to position it as instructed. There is usually a sticker next to the SIM card slot, or an engraving illustrating the SIM's correct orientation.

 Replace the SIM card in your phone, and power up again. The "SIM not provisioned" error should no longer appear. If it does, try the SIM in another phone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Activate Your SIM Card

 In most cases, a SIM card will be activated automatically within 24 hours of being inserted into a new phone. If this doesn't happen, three options are usually available to enable activation:

* Call an automated number.
* Send an SMS.
* Log onto the activation page on the carrier's website.

 If you've switched to an eSIM, it's possible your old physical SIM will still be activated. You can't have two SIMs tied to the same phone number, so make sure you activate your eSIM to deactivate the old SIM.

 All these options are quick and straightforward but depend on whether the carrier supports them. In most cases, your SIM should be activated, and the "SIM not provisioned" error solved.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 6\. Contact Your Carrier or Network Provider

 If the SIM doesn't activate, it's time to make a call (from another device!) to your carrier or network. Explain to them the error message and the steps you've taken so far.

 As noted above, there may be an issue with the activation server, which would prevent your SIM card from activating. This would cause the "SIM not provisioned" error message.

 Your carrier will typically keep you on the line while they investigate the issue. If it is a problem with the activation server, there may be some delay in getting the SIM activated. On the plus side, you'll have a reason for the error and a possible date for resolution.

### 7\. Get a New SIM Card

![new SIM card](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/muo-android-sim-not-provisioned-new.jpg)

 Still no joy? It's time to request a new SIM card, maybe even an eSIM, if your phone supports it. You could call your network for this, but you'll probably find it's quicker to head to a local phone shop. Even better, a branch of your network or a franchise outlet.

 They'll be able to run diagnostics on the SIM card and hopefully, resolve the "SIM not provisioned MM2" error. Don't worry if they repeat some of the steps you've already attempted, as this is part of the diagnostic process.

 If it means you need a new SIM card, this shouldn't be a problem. The store will have the tools in place to manage the swap and associate the new SIM with your account.

## The "SIM Not Provisioned MM 2" Error, Fixed

 By this point, you should understand why your phone is displaying the "SIM not provisioned MM2" error message. If none of these things work, then you'll need to contact your carrier/network provider to ask for a replacement card. Once you've got everything sorted, your SIM card should work without a problem.

 Unfortunately, new SIM card errors are appearing all the time, but it doesn't take long for the internet to rally together and start providing at-home solutions. If you find yourself experiencing SIM issues, it's always worth conducting a quick online search to see if someone has found a solution or a workaround.
