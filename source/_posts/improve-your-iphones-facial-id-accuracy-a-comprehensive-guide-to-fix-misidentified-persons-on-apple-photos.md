## Improve Your iPhone's Facial ID Accuracy: A Comprehensive Guide to Fix Misidentified Persons on Apple Photos

 The Photos app automatically identifies people in your Photos to curate People albums for each of them. However, Apple's artificial intelligence isn't perfect, and oftentimes, your Apple devices will make an error and save the wrong person in someone else's album. This can happen due to the poor quality of a picture, the similarities of someone's face, or various other reasons.

 Here's how you can review photos of identified people in the Photos app and fix any cases of mistaken identity, where your iPhone has tagged one person as someone else.

## How to Review People in Photos on an iPhone or iPad

 To search for any misidentified photos of someone, you should first review your confirmed and uncategorized photos for that person to help your device learn what each person is supposed to look like. Here's how to do that:

1. In**Photos** , go to**Albums > People** album and tap on the person's profile you want to sort through.
2. Tap the**three dots** in the top-right corner, and select**Review Confirmed Photos** .
3. You should now see photos of this person. Tap on any picture of someone else to deselect it and press**Done** . If you don't see any, tap**Review More Photos** .
4. A popup will appear with a photo, asking**Is This X?** Tap**Yes** or**No** . Your device will automatically take you through all the photos for review. If you get tired at any point, just tap**Done** and you will go back to your previous page.

## How to Fix Misidentified People in Photos on iPhone or iPad

 If your iPhone has misidentified someone in a photo, they won't show up when you search for them and instead Photos will save pictures of them in someone else's album. What's more, that person—who might be a stranger—will show up in the People album for whoever your iPhone thinks they are! Here's how to fix it:

1. In**Photos** , go to**Albums > People** and tap the profile you want to remove a misidentified picture from.
2. Tap**Select** and select the misidentified photos you want to remove.
3. Hit the**Share** button in the bottom-left corner of your screen.
4. Choose**This is Not X** , and the selected photos will be removed from that album.

## Easily Sort Pictures With the People Album

 The People album in Photos is a great way to view your photo library in an organized way. You can easily look back at all your memories with a particular person without needing to scroll past a sea of unrelated pictures.

 However, having misidentified photos in the wrong albums can be quite a nuisance to deal with. Fortunately, the problem has a relatively quick and easy fix. You can review uncategorized photos to avoid the problem in the future, and you can remove any mismatched pictures you stumble across using the Share button.
