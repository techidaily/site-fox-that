## IPhone Control Center Malfunction? Here Are 8 Remedies That Work

 The Control Center is a pretty neat feature that instantly gives you access to the essential controls on your iPhone. You can quickly access the connectivity options, control the volume, and adjust the brightness of your screen, among many other nitty-gritty features.

 Since it's so important, It can be a real bummer when the Control Center on your iPhone stops working. Below, we'll look at all the potential troubleshooting steps to fix this issue and bring all the crucial controls back to your fingertips.

## 1\. Clean Your iPhone's Screen

 Your iPhone's display not being able to register your touch inputs could be the reason you're unable to access the Control Center. It might be because you're using a thick protective case on your iPhone that might overlap your display, preventing you from accessing the Control Center.

 Besides this, the quality and condition of your screen protector can also be why you can't access the Control Center. So, if it has scratches or cracks on it, replace it with a new one. And even if you're not using your iPhone with a screen protector, its display isn't immune to dust and dirt that accumulate over time.

 Because of this, your screen's touch sensitivity and accuracy may reduce, making it unresponsive to touch. The best way to fix this issue is to remove the screen protector and [clean your iPhone's display](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/) with a microfiber cloth. And when you're done, see if you're able to open the Control Center.

## 2\. Turn Off VoiceOver

 For those unaware, VoiceOver is one of the many [accessibility features in iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/overview-of-all-accessibility-features-iphone/) that lets a visually impaired person interact with their iPhone. It's a gesture-based screen reader that gives an audio description of what's on the screen. Unfortunately, you can't access the Control Center when VoiceOver is active.

 So, if you accidentally activated this feature, you can turn it off by heading over to**Settings** \>**Accessibility** . Once you're here, tap**VoiceOver** and toggle off the switch at the top. Now, try opening the Control Center on your iPhone.

## 3\. Enable Control Center Access When Locked

 This one is for those having trouble accessing Control Center from the Lock Screen on their iPhones. It only happens when you don't give access to Control Center when your iPhone is locked.

 Here's how you can give access to Control Center when your iPhone is locked:

1. Open the**Setting** app on your iPhone and navigate to**Face ID & Passcode** .
2. Enter your passcode for verification and scroll down to**Allow Access When Locked** section.
3. Enable the**Control Center** toggle.

 After this, you should be able to access the Control Center from your iPhone'sLock Screen.

## 4\. Enable Control Center Access Within Apps

 Similarly, this one is for those unable to access the Control Center while using apps. If that's the case, it's likely happening because you've accidentally disabled Control Center access within apps on your iPhone.

 The process of enabling Control Center access within apps is pretty straightforward. Open the**Settings** app, select**Control Center** , and toggle on**Access Within Apps** .

## 6\. Remove and Add Controls to Control Center

 Therefore, removing that control might fix the issue. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Launch the**Settings** app on your iPhone and go to**Control Center** .
2. Press the**minus icon** **(-)** next to the control you want to delete.
3. Tap the red**Remove** button.

Close

 After [customizing the Control Center on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-customize-control-center-iphone/) , try launching it again to check if the issue is fixed.

## 7\. Restart Your iPhone

 The best and quickest approach to resolve any software issue you might be experiencing on your iPhone is to restart it. Therefore, a simple restart should fix this Control Center issue. However, there's no dedicated restart button, so you need to turn it off and back on.

 To shut down your iPhone, press and hold the side or power button if you have an iPhone 8 or older model. On the other hand, if you have an iPhone X or newer model, long-press the side and either volume down together. Then, drag the power-off slider to the right to turn it off.

 You can [restart your iPhone even if its buttons are broken](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) . Turn your iPhone on and check if you can access the Control Center.

## 8\. Reset Your iPhone's Settings

 This method won't impact the data stored on your iPhone, but it will fix any issues you're facing and return all of your iPhone's settings to their factory default values. Here's what you need to do:

1. Open**Settings** and select**General** .
2. Scroll down and select the**Transfer or Reset iPhone** option.
3. Tap**Reset** and choose**Reset All Settings** .
