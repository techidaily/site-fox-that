## Can't Get Your iPhone to Vibrate in Ring or Silent Mode? Use These 8 Techniques to Resolve the Issue

 When your iPhone is in your pocket or bag, a vibration helps to inform you about an incoming call or text if you're unable to hear the sound of your alert tone. If you're in a quiet place like a library, it's even more important to ensure your iPhone vibrates instead of rings so that you don't disturb others.

 To ensure your iPhone can vibrate to notify you at all times, here's what you can do when you notice your iPhone is not vibrating on Silent or Ring mode.

 Your browser does not support the video tag.

## 1\. Check Your iPhone's Current Mode

 Before proceeding to tweak your iPhone's sound settings, check if your iPhone is in the mode you want. Look at the side of your iPhone for the Ring/Silent switch.

 If you can see the orange strip, your iPhone is in Silent mode. Push the switch (so that the orange strip is no longer showing) to put your iPhone back in Ring mode.

## 2\. Turn On System Haptics

 Haptic feedback is an iPhone feature that provides a physical response, usually in the form of a subtle pulse or vibration, as you interact with your device. If you don't enable System Haptics, this will cause your iPhone to not vibrate at all.

 To turn on System Haptics, go to**Settings > Sounds & Haptics** . Then, toggle on**System Haptics** .

Close

## 3\. Enable Vibration in Accessibility

 Besides**Sounds & Haptics** , another place you need to check is your**Accessibility** settings. If vibration isn't enabled here, your iPhone will not vibrate on Silent or Ring mode either.

 Therefore, go to**Settings > Accessibility > Touch** , and then toggle on**Vibration** .

![touch settings in iphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/touch-settings.JPEG)

Close

## 4\. Check Your Vibration Setting for Ring and Silent Mode

 Now, if your iPhone vibrates on Silent mode but doesn't on Ring mode (or vice versa), it's likely because you set a different vibration preference for each mode. To check this, go to**Settings > Sounds & Haptics** .

 If you want your iPhone to vibrate regardless of the mode selected, toggle on both**Play Haptics in Ring Mode** and**Play Haptics in Silent Mode** .

![play haptics for ring and silent mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MUO-in-article-image-(1200px-by-600px-21-ratio)-(11)-1.jpg)

## 5\. Check the Selected Vibration Pattern for Each Alert

 If you have gone through the three troubleshooting methods above, but your iPhone is still not vibrating on Silent or Ring mode, it's time to check your vibration pattern settings.

 Go to**Settings > Sounds & Haptics** . Under the**Sounds and Haptics Pattern** section, let's start by tapping on**Ringtone** . Then, tap**Vibration** .

 This is where you can [set custom vibration alerts on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/vibration-patterns-iphone-alerts/) . But among the vibration options available, notice that one of them is**None** , which means your iPhone will not vibrate at all if you select this.

 Check that you have**Synchronized** or one of the Standard vibration patterns selected, such as**Accent** or**Alert** . If you have**Custom** selected, tap on it to play the vibration recording and make sure it's not just an accidental replica of**None** .

 After you select a valid vibration pattern for**Ringtone** , go back to the**Sounds and Haptics Pattern** list. Repeat these steps for**Text Tone** ,**New Voicemail** ,**New Mail** , and so on.

## 6\. Update Your iPhone

 Apple's iOS software updates often come with bug fixes and performance improvements. So, if the above methods don't work for you, it may simply be a bug in the software itself.

 Therefore,[updating your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/) may be the solution when your device doesn't vibrate on Silent or Ring mode.

## 7\. Restart Your iPhone

 Software glitches can sometimes prevent your iPhone from vibrating, whether it's on Ring or Silent mode. In such cases, simply restarting your iPhone will resolve the problem, making this troubleshooting step worth trying. Note that different steps may be required to [restart your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) , depending on the model you own.

## 8\. Reset All Settings

 If all else fails, you can attempt to reset all settings on your iPhone. This procedure returns all settings on your device to the default factory state.

 If you have a lot of data on your device, the process can take quite a while, so you should only try this method when you don't need to use your iPhone immediately.

 Go to **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset** . Choose**Reset All Settings** .

 Do not accidentally select**Erase All Content and Settings,** as this will delete all the data on your iPhone.

## Can You Enable Vibration for Calls and Texts Only on Your iPhone?

 If the solutions above worked and your iPhone can vibrate on Silent and Ring mode again, there's still a dilemmaâ€”what if you want your iPhone to only vibrate for incoming calls and texts, but not system haptics?

 You're not alone if you find the vibration from haptic feedback irritating and uncomfortable. Unfortunately, there's no way to enable vibration for calls and texts only on your iPhone right now. Once you toggle off**System Haptics** or**Vibration** , it turns off all iPhone vibrations.

 However, you can sacrifice vibration on Ring mode to make your iPhone vibrate only in Silent mode. To get this, you need to:

1. Toggle on**System Haptics** in**Sounds & Haptics** .
2. Toggle off**Play Haptics in Ring Mode** , then toggle on**Play Haptics in Silent Mode** .
3. Toggle on**Vibration** in**Accessibility > Touch** .

![turn on play haptics in silent mode and system haptics](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_4013.JPEG)

![touch settings in iphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/touch-settings.JPEG)

Close

 Additionally, to cut down on system haptics as much as possible on Silent mode, you can also go to**Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Keyboard Feedback** and toggle off**Haptic** . This way, you'll at least avoid experiencing tapping vibrations each time you type a letter on your iPhone's keyboard.

## Use Your iPhone's Vibrations to Be Aware of Alerts

 When it comes to the iPhone, the key is turning on**System Haptics** and**Vibration** and ensuring you have a functioning vibration pattern selected for the alerts.
