## Newbie's Blueprint: How to Effortlessly Use Bluetooth Features on an iPhone

 Bluetooth has been around for decades now, and the tool has become a vital part of modern gadgets. It might do you good to learn the workings of Bluetooth on your iPhone, especially since the iPhone’s user interface makes essential Bluetooth functions pretty easy to perform.

 In this guide, we’ll take a look at what Bluetooth is, what it can be used for, where it can be found, and the basic operations that can be performed on an iPhone, including pairing, enabling, and renaming Bluetooth devices.

## What Can You Use Bluetooth For?

 Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows you to communicate or connect with various devices through radio waves. When your iPhone is within 33 feet of a connected Bluetooth device, you can use Bluetooth on your iPhone to transfer tons of files, images, and more between the two devices.

 You can also use Bluetooth to connect to third-party devices, such as speakers, AirPods, keyboards, gaming controllers, and headsets.

## How to Enable or Disable Bluetooth on an iPhone

 You can access the Bluetooth through the Control Center or through your iPhone’s settings. You can enable and disable Bluetooth in the iPhone’s Settings, while the Control Center will only allow you to enable it.

 If you do tap on the Bluetooth button in the Control Center to turn it off, it will disconnect your iPhone from paired devices and stop new Bluetooth connections. This happens even though Bluetooth is still enabled in Settings. We’ll describe both methods of enabling and disabling Bluetooth below.

Here’s how you can enable or disable Bluetooth from Settings:

1. Open**Settings** and go to**Bluetooth** .
2. Tap on the toggle next to**Bluetooth** to turn it on or off.

Close

Here’s how you can disconnect Bluetooth from Control Center:

1. If you have an iPhone with Face ID, swipe down from the top-right corner of your screen to access Control Center. For devices with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.
2. Tap on the Bluetooth icon to enable it or disconnect devices.
3. If the icon in the Control Center is blue, it indicates that Bluetooth is on. If the icon is gray, it indicates that Bluetooth is disconnected from all devices. If it has a diagonal line across it, it means that Bluetooth is disabled.

## What to Do if Bluetooth Isn’t Working on Your iPhone

 Bluetooth tends to work seamlessly and is easy to operate. However, like all other technology, it isn’t perfect and might be difficult to work with at some point. There are several obvious troubleshooting tips that will help to get your Bluetooth up and running if you have any issues.

 Here is a list of [potential solutions to Bluetooth problems](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-iphone-bluetooth-not-working/) :

### 1\. Update iOS

 This can be done in**Settings > General > Software Update.** If your software is already up to date, move on to the next step.

### 2\. Forget a Device and Pair It Again

 This is one of the most popular fixes out there. Select**Forget this Device** from your Bluetooth Settings, disable Bluetooth from devices, enable it again, and try pairing it as a completely new, unrecognized device. Oftentimes, a fresh start is all your iPhone needs to get its bearings.

### 3\. Pair the Bluetooth Device to Another iPhone

 This will rule out any defects in the device you’re trying to pair. If the problem persists while connecting with another iPhone, then there might be a Bluetooth issue in the device itself. You can also do this by attempting to connect your iPhone with another Bluetooth device instead to see if your phone is working.

### 4\. Reset the Network Settings

 When all else fails, or your Bluetooth problems get too frequent, you can reset the network settings by going to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.** This will wipe out all saved Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and VPN configurations on your iPhone. Just make all those connections again like you did when your phone was new.

## Bluetooth Is an Indispensable Tool, So Use It Well

 Bluetooth can be found in your iPhone’s Settings, and there are a number of things you can do with it. On your iPhone, you can pair, unpair, rename devices, and enable or disable Bluetooth. You can also find Bluetooth in the Control Center, which provides quick and easy access to connect or disconnect from paired devices.
