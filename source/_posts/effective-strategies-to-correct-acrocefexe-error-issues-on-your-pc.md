### Fix 2:**Verify Integrity of Game Files**

 You may run into this error if the files of the game you’re playing are faulty or corrupt.

If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. This may help fix the error.

To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .

4. Click**LOCAL FILES** \>**Verify integrity of game files…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lf.png)
5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.
6. Once finished, launch the game to see if it can be played properly. If yes, congrats! If it’s still no joy, please continue with**Fix 3** . below.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Launch the game in Steam again to see if the issue is resolved. If yes, then great. If the error still pops up, please try**Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5:**Run Steam as administrator**

 The fatal error may be related to issues with game installations or with Steam updates. So you can grant Steam administrator privileges so that it can run in the most optimized way. Once you’ve done that, check if the error still occurs.

Here is how to run Steam as administrator:

1. In your desktop, right-click on**your Steam shortcut** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s.png)
2. Click the**Compatibility** tab, then tick the**Run this program as an administrator** box. Finally, click**Apply** \>**OK** .

3. Re-launch Steam and the game.
4. Check if the Steam Fatal Error is fixed.

 Error still persists? Don’t worry. Here are a few more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 7: Check for an update

 The error may be an unresolved bug of a previous version. Whenever the developers are aware of the issue, they would try to fix it and release a new version. You can check Steam or the game in question to see if there’s a new update available. Once you make sure you’ve installed the latest update of Steam and the game, check to see if the fatal error is fixed.

 Still no luck? Please try**Fix 8** , below.

### Fix 8: Reinstall Steam

 If you’ve exhausted all possible fixes but the error still happens, you can reinstall Steam as a last resort. Many players may fear this would delete all installed games, but you can easily save them by backing up the Steamapps folder – that way you wouldn’t need to redownload a single game after reinstalling Steam.

**To back up the Steamapps folder:**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Windows-logo-key.jpg) and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer, then copy and paste**`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`** into the address bar and press**Enter** . This will open the installation directory of Steam.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1.png)
2. In list of folders, locate the**Steamapps** folder. Then copy it into a different folder on your computer.

**To uninstall and reinstall Steam:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type**steam** . Right-click on**Steam** as it pops up as a matching result, and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-5.png)
2. In the window that opens, right-click on Steam and click**Uninstall** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. Follow the on-screen instructions until the app is fully removed from your computer.
4. Navigate to[**Steam official website**](https://store.steampowered.com/) to download the latest version of Steam and install Steam.

**To recover your games:**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer, then copy and paste**`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`** into the address bar and press**Enter** . This will open the installation directory of Steam.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1.png)
2. Paste the old**Steamapps** folder into to overwrite the new folder.

 Once finished, run the faulty game on Steam and see if the issue is fixed.
