## What Causes Error 4013 When Updating or Restoring Your iPhone?

 Error 4013 is most commonly caused by incompatibility with your current version of macOS or iTunes (on Windows). You can check if any new macOS updates are available by clicking**Apple logo > System Settings > Software Update** . Once you're in the Software Update section, macOS will automatically check whether any updates are available.

 If an update is available, a prompt with a button that reads**Update Now** will appear. Click the button and allow macOS to update, ensuring that your computer is plugged in without the process. Don't put it to sleep or close its lid. Otherwise,[macOS may get stuck during the updating process](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-macos-update-stuck/) and cause more trouble.

 If you're using iTunes on a Windows PC to update or restore your iPhone, click**Help > Check for Updates** from the app's menu bar to update it to the latest version.

## 2\. Restart Your iPhone

 Minor software glitches in iOS can also cause error 4013 to pop up on iTunes or Finder while trying to update or restore your iPhone. To quickly resolve this, you can [restart your iPhone](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) , which is pretty easy even if the buttons are broken.

 And if that doesn't help, you can always [force restart (or soft reset) your iPhone](http://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-soft-reset/) with a combination of button presses.

## 3\. Use a Different Lightning Cable

 You could also try swapping the Lightning cable you're using to see if it resolves error 4013\. As you probably know, Apple's Lightning cables never last and undergo wear and tear pretty easily.

 Disconnect the cable you were using and swap it out for a [high-quality MFi-certified Lightning cable](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-lightning-cables-charge-iphone-ipad/) . Then, reconnect your iPhone, relaunch iTunes or Finder, and attempt the update or restoration again.

## 4\. Clean Your PC and iPhone Ports

 Debris inside your PC's USB and iPhone Lightning ports can also cause connectivity issues. So, it's worth cleaning it thoroughly to see if that resolves the error 4013 pop-up appearing in iTunes or Finder.

 Remember to power off both your devices before proceeding, though. You can remove debris from the ports by spraying compressed air into the port at an angle or directly dislodging it with a toothpick or the SIM ejector tool your iPhone came with.
