## The Most Frequent iPhone 12 Issues and Their Easy Resolutions Explained

 Owners of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are generally quite happy with the device. From camera results to intensive gaming and processing, the overall performance of this device makes it worth a shot.

 However, you may experience some issues with iPhone 12 at some point in life. Fortunately, most of these issues are fixable. So, before you consider investing in a new phone, let's dig deeper into the biggest iPhone 12 issues and see how to fix them.

## 1\. No SIM or Invalid SIM Error on iPhone 12

 Thanks to Wi-Fi, many people forget the existence of SIM cards. What's the point of dialing from your phone if you are getting facilities to call and message people without extra charges?

 You might not notice that your iPhone has lost the SIM connection until it's actually needed. iPhone 12 might lose its connection to a SIM card due to a glitch in an update, a damaged SIM or port, improper tray placement, or a malfunction in the iOS system.

Before taking it to the nearest Apple Store, try these steps:

![Airplane mode on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-on-iPhone-1.JPG)

![Airplane mode off](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-off-1.JPG)

Close

1. Confirm that your SIM card is active and ready to use.
2. Activate Airplane Mode on the phone and turn it off. Your iPhone 12 should start catching signals.
3. If enabling/disabling Airplane Mode doesn't fix your problem, turn off the phone and take out your SIM tray.
4. Examine your SIM to confirm if there's any damage or not.
5. Put the SIM with the SIM tray back in the phone.
6. Restart your iPhone 12\. It should show mobile signals now.

 You may need to update iOS if the above method doesn't work. You can do so by going to**Settings > General > Software Update** on your iPhone. But if that doesn't solve the issue either, replace the SIM or get it inserted by a professional.

 If none of the steps seem to work, your SIM port is probably busted and might need repair by a professional.

## 2\. Problems With Face ID on iPhone 12

 iPhone 12 is one of the newer models that support Apple's face recognition system. It is an additional security step that lets you unlock the phone and authorize different transactions on the device.

 Users might experience issues because of improper lighting or objects near the face when [setting up Face ID on the iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/set-up-face-id-on-iphone-ipad/) . If you cannot unlock your phone, clean the sensors (or the entire screen) with a soft microfiber cloth.

## 10\. iTunes and App Store Problems

2. Change your internet connection to a faster/more stable one.
