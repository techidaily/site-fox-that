## 10 Essential Remedies for Constant Crashes in Your iPhone's Favorite Apps

 Picture this: you're launching your favorite game on your iPhone only to find that it keeps crashing no matter how many times you try. Or perhaps you and some friends already have your selfie poses ready, but your favorite camera app keeps crashing on your iPhone.

 So, why do your iPhone apps keep crashing? Let's look at the solutions you can apply when your apps keep closing on your iPhone.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 If your app requires an internet connection to function, poor Wi-Fi or hotspot connection may cause your iPhone app to crash repeatedly. You can test whether your internet is functional with a simple Google search on the Safari app and loading some web pages.

 To solve internet connection problems, try to restart your router, connect to a different Wi-Fi network, or apply these [solutions if your iPhone's hotspot isn't working](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tethering-ios-fix-iphone-personal-hotspot-issues/) .

## 2\. Charge Your iPhone

![iPhone being charged with a MagSafe charger](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charge-your-iphone-with-a-wireless-charger.jpg)

 If you're playing a multiplayer game with high-quality graphics, yet there's only a battery level of 10 percent left on your iPhone, your app might close abruptly because your device is struggling to provide enough power to support it.

 If it's an urgent case, quickly plugging in your iPhone to charge it may temporarily prevent the app from crashing again. However, it's not advisable to frequently charge your iPhone this way.

 Heavy usage of your iPhone while charging will likely result in overheating. This might cause your apps to crash all over again. It's also bad practice if you want to [maintain your iPhone's battery health](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-maintain-your-iphones-battery-health/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Close and Relaunch the App

 Even if an app closes abruptly on your iPhone, it may still be open in the background, albeit unresponsive. When you re-open the app from the App Switcher, it may only display a blank screen and crash once more.

 In this case, try exiting the app completely before relaunching it. Access the**App Switcher** , swipe to the opened app, and swipe up to close it. Then, head to your**Home Screen** to relaunch the app.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Update the App

 Developers often release app updates to fix bugs and patch other performance issues. When your apps keep crashing on your iPhone, updating them may just be the trick to solving it.

 To quickly check whether a specific app has an update, go to the App Store's**Search** tab to find the app. If an update is available, you'll see an**Update** button instead of the usual**Open** button. Tap on it to update the app.

## 5\. Update Your iPhone

 Like individual app updates, Apple's iOS updates also come with bug fixes and the like. When your iPhone apps keep crashing, you should also try to [update iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/) if the above solutions have not worked so far.

 Go to**Settings > General > Software Update** to see if an update is available for your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Restart Your iPhone

 Restarting your iPhone often solves most technical hiccups, including repeated app crashes. The steps to [restart your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restart-iphone-recovery-mode/) are easy, but it does vary depending on your iPhone model.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Remove and Reinstall the App

 If no app updates are available, another solution is to remove and reinstall the problematic app. Before you do so, remember that this erases all the app's local data on your iPhone. For example, if it's a game app and you did not link your account to other platforms such as Facebook or Google, you will lose all progress.

 If you're sure you want to proceed, go to the Home Screen, long-press the app, and then tap on**Remove App** to uninstall. Choose**Delete App** to confirm. To reinstall the app, go to the App Store and use the**Search** tab to find the app. Tap the**Cloud** icon to reinstall.

![reinstall tetris app from iphone app store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MUO-in-article-image-(1200px-by-600px-21-ratio)-(11).jpg)

 However, if you're facing problems with reinstalling the app, check that you're signed in to the same Apple ID to [restore deleted apps and in-app purchases on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restore-deleted-app-iphone/) properly.

## 8\. Check Your iPhone's Storage

 Low storage space may affect your iPhone's efficiency and cause your apps to keep crashing. If your iPhone storage is indeed nearly full, it's best to start [creating free space on iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-storage-full-create-free-space-ios/) .

 To check your current storage situation, go to**Settings > General > iPhone Storage** to get an overview of which apps are taking up the most space. And if you see any apps you don't use, make sure to remove them.

## 9\. Reset All Settings

 One of the last solutions you can attempt is to reset all settings on your iPhone. This procedure restores all your iPhone's settings to their default or factory state. Go to**Settings >** **General** , scroll down to the bottom, and tap on**Transfer or Reset iPhone** . Select**Reset** and choose**Reset All Settings** .

 Your iPhone won't delete any data as long as you don't accidentally choose to**Erase All Content and Settings** .

## 10\. Consider Upgrading Your iPhone

 Sometimes the issue goes beyond what an app developer can account for. For example, if you're browsing a large e-commerce site and scrolling through an endless array of products, it's hard for an iPhone 5 to keep up even if the app is compatible with older versions of iOS.

 Therefore, your device's age may be the main culprit when you find that your iPhone apps keep crashing. Consider upgrading to a new model if multiple issues (besides app crashes) are severely impacting the functionality of your iPhone.

## iPhone Apps Still Keep Crashing? Your Device May Not Be the Problem

 If you're using a recent iPhone model and have tried all the above solutions, the issue may be the app itself when it keeps closing. Although this is beyond your control, there are still some steps you can take.

### Check if an App Update Is in Development

 An iPhone app that keeps crashing for many users is no small issue. Visit the app's official website or social media pages. Here, developers may announce that they are aware of the issue and are working on a hotfix or update to fix it.

 This way, you will know whether or not the developers plan to fix the crashing issue in a future update. And if they are, all you need to do is wait for its release.

### Provide Feedback to the App Developer

 In case you didn't spot any announcements, you can provide feedback to the developers via email or other designated channels. Sometimes, only users of a particular platform or device will experience frequent app crashes, and developers may be unaware of the extent of the issue, especially if it's an indie app with a smaller customer base.

 While it's understandably frustrating that your iPhone app keeps crashing when you want to use it, be polite and constructive in your feedback. Remember that app developers are people, too!

### Replace With a Similar App

 If you notice that the latest version history of the app was a year or two ago, and its social media hasn't been updated in ages, chances are that the developers are no longer active. So, it's best to head to the App Store to install another app that serves the same purpose to replace your current one.

## Get Your iPhone Apps Working Again

 If you've had a headache over wondering why your apps keep crashing on your iPhone, we hope our list of fixes has helped you resolve the problem.

 Focus on finding out if it's an app-specific issue or whether the root cause is an outdated device. It's always worth keeping things up-to-date on your iPhone to enjoy the latest features and ensure app compatibility.
