## Don't Delay! Discover How iOS 15.3 Enhances Security and Features on Your Apple Device

 In most cases, iOS updates come with a slew of features that are designed to improve user experience. However, iOS 15.3 arrives with a different priority—fixing security flaws in the iPhone’s operating system.

 Despite Apple’s attempts to give Safari users a tracker-free browser experience, a critical security bug put a wrench in its plans. Thankfully, developers may have found a way around it. Here’s why you must update your iOS device now.

## Why It’s Important to Update to iOS 15.3

 In November 2021, a [Safari 15 security issue](https://www.makeuseof.com/safari-15-leaking-browsing-history-how-to-prevent/) left user data vulnerable across various platforms. Because of an IndexedDB bug, Safari revealed database information that leaks users’ browser histories and, possibly, their Google ID data. Previously, there were no known fixes for the Safari 15 bug, so iOS users with Safari were advised to use alternative browsers.

 In January 2021,[Apple](https://support.apple.com/HT213053) released an update that can solve this issue with iOS 15.3\. While Apple doesn’t officially disclose the details of the update for security reasons, it’s likely that it may be the key to solving the Safari 15 vulnerability.

 The new update also fixes various other critical security flaws with iOS, including an issue that made it possible for applications to access a user’s iCloud data.

 At the same time, Apple is also rolling out updates for Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and HomePod. With macOS 12.2, it is also likely that Apple will fix the same Safari issues for Mac users.
