## 3\. Try to install RoboCop: Rogue City on your SSD

 Some gamers mentioned that installing RoboCop: Rogue City on their SSD instead of HDD managed to fix the game crashing problem for them. This is probably because SSD is more powerful and a lot faster when processing game files. So if your RoboCop: Rogue City freezes or crashes easily, please make sure that it’s installed on an SSD instead of an HDD.

To tell whether you have an SSD or an HDD, please view the Task Manager:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-11.png)
2. Click the second icon (**Performance** ), then check the **Type** field.

## 4\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your RoboCop: Rogue City’s crashing problem, so if the above methods don’t help to fix the crashing issue with RoboCop: Rogue City, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png)  

**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

## 6\. Make sure your computer is not overheating

 It’s also worth noting that a very common reason why games crash is that the computer is overheating, especially when the CPU and GPU are running hot. So if the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, or not strong enough for all your hardware components when resource-hungry programs like games are running, then there’ll be problems like sudden computer shut down and constant game crashes, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you run RoboCop: Rogue City, you need a cooler environment for your machine to make sure that the crashing problem doesn’t happen again.

 Here is a detailed post regarding how to check your PC temperature and what you can do to cool your computer down if it’s overheating: **[How to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
