## 1\. Enable Name and Photo Sharing with Contacts

 If you created your Contact Poster recently, you may have accidentally disabled the feature that allows you to share your poster with your contacts. It's alrightâ€”mistakes happen, and enabling the feature again will only take a few seconds! Follow the steps below:

1. Open the**Phone** app on your device and head to the**Contacts** section from the bottom.
2. Tap**My Card** at the top of your contact list, and then tap**Contact Photo & Poster** .
3. Now, check whether**Name & Photo Sharing** is enabled. If not, toggle it on.
4. Make sure the**Share Automatically** setting is set to**Contacts Only** .

 If someone you know has set up their Contact Poster and you can't see it, simply ask them to follow the steps above and ensure the feature is enabled!

## 2\. Delete and Recreate the Contact Poster

 If the above fix doesn't work, we recommend deleting your Contact Poster entirely and creating a new one. Here's how you can delete your current Contact Poster:

1. Launch the**Phone** app and go to your contact card by tapping**My Card** .
2. Tap**Contact Photo & Poster** and then tap the**Edit** button below your current Contact Poster.
3. Swipe up on a**Contact Poster** and tap the**Trash** icon. To confirm your selection, tap**Delete** .
4. Finally,[create and customize a new Contact Poster](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-contact-posters-on-iphone/) for yourself and your contacts.

## 3\. Disable Name and Photo Sharing and Restart Your iPhone

 Perhaps a software bug is the culprit behind this issue. Fortunately, the simplest way to fix software glitches like this one is restarting your iPhone. Before you restart your iPhone, head to**Phone > My Card > Contact Photo & Poster** and disable**Name & Photo Sharing** .

 Whether you're using a model with a notch or Dynamic Island or an old-school iPhone with a physical Home button,[restarting your iPhone, even if the buttons aren't working](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) , is pretty straightforward. After you turn your iPhone back on, follow the steps above to enable**Name & Photo Sharing** again.

## It's Time to Get Your Contact Posters Back

 If none of the troubleshooting steps we mentioned above worked, you may be experiencing this issue due to an iOS bug. Fortunately, Apple periodically rolls out software updates to resolve well-known problems like this. While it isn't ideal, we recommend waiting it out until a new update is available. Alternatively, you can contact Apple Support for expert assistance.
