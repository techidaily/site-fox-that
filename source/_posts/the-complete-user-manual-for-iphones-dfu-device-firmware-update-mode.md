## The Complete User Manual for iPhone's DFU (Device Firmware Update) Mode

 Most of the faults your iPhone software will develop can be solved with a few tricks or by resetting it using Recovery mode. On rare occasions, however, those options may not work. Before you search for the nearest Apple repair center, you should try to restore your iPhone using DFU mode instead.

 In this article, we’ll check out how to put your iPhone in DFU mode and also how to exit this mode.

## What Is DFU Mode?

 DFU stands for Device Firmware Update, and this is a special mode built into the Apple mobile operating system (iOS). It is an advanced recovery mode, as it fixes problems that are found in the firmware as well as the software.

 In this mode, your iOS device is powered on, but your operating system isn’t booted up, so you can alter the operating system. Here, your device will interact with Finder or iTunes on a Mac or Windows computer without it automatically updating your iOS version.

 Using DFU mode, you can upgrade or downgrade your iOS version, update from a beta version, and jailbreak your iPhone—or [un-jailbreak your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-restore-jailbroken-iphone-ipad-stock-right-way/) .

 This is a useful last-resort fix to rule out software problems, and it’s an effective way to [restore a device that is stuck on Apple’s logo](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-iphone-stuck-apple-logo/) , buggy, or unresponsive. Entering this mode is tricky, though, as it requires precise timing and multiple steps.

 But don’t fret. If you follow the detailed instructions in the sections below, you’ll be able to use DFU mode successfully.

## Does DFU Mode Delete iPhone Data?

 Unfortunately, if you use this mode to install something or restore your device, all of your iPhone’s data will be erased. This works similarly to the iTunes restore method, which also deletes all of your data.

 It completely erases your iPhone, erasing all of your videos, photos, messages, apps, and even the previously configured settings. When you’re finished with this mode, you’ll have to reset your device to use it. We recommend backing up your files before entering DFU mode, then restoring them after the process.

## How to Enter DFU Mode on Your iPhone

Before you begin:

* [Back up your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-iphone-ipad/) if possible, as a DFU restore will erase your iPhone data.
* Install the latest version of iTunes or macOS on your Windows or Mac.
* Do not disconnect your iPhone when iTunes or Finder is actively reinstalling the system software and firmware.
* Do not try to use DFU mode to restore a device that is water damaged, as this simply won’t work.

 It is necessary to note that using DFU mode to downgrade iOS or jailbreak your device can cause damage and void the warranty.

 Entering DFU mode involves a combination of pressing, holding, and releasing different buttons on your iPhone. You will also need a compatible USB cable to connect the device to a Mac or a Windows PC running the latest version of macOS or iTunes.

 The key combinations for entering DFU mode differ depending on your iPhone model. Rest assured, no matter which iPhone you’ve got, we have specific instructions for you to activate DFU mode on your device.

## DFU Is Powerful, But Not Perfect

 A DFU restore is not the ultimate fix for all iPhone problems Some issues may be plain hardware faults and cannot be fixed with system software or firmware restore. If your iPhone stubbornly refuses to enter DFU mode, or the issues persist after performing a reset, consider seeking a professional repair instead.
