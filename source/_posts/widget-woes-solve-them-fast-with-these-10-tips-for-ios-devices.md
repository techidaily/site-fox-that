## Widget Woes? Solve Them Fast with These 10 Tips for iOS Devices

 Do you keep running into issues with widgets not loading, updating, or displaying data on your iPhone or iPad? Software-related bugs and conflicting settings often cause that.

 So let's check out what you can do to fix your iPhone or iPad widgets, either in the Today View or on the Home screen.

## 1\. Restart Your iPhone or iPad

 If a specific widget or set of widgets appears blank or won't load, it's best to kick things off by restarting your iPhone or iPad. That's a quick way to fix most issues brought about by buggy apps and system software.

 To do that, open the Settings app and select**General** \>**Shut Down** . After the device finishes shutting down, hold down the**Side** or**Top** button to reboot it.

## 2\. Update the Apps on Your iPhone or iPad

 Try updating the apps on your iPhone or iPad. Newer updates versions usually come with lots of fixes for known problems preventing widgets from functioning normally.

 If you don't have automatic app updates enabled, just long-press the**App Store** icon and select**Updates** . Next, perform a swipe-down gesture to scan for the latest updates and tap**Update All** to install them.

## 3\. Update iOS or iPadOS

 Early builds of major system software iterations—such as iOS 15.0 and iPadOS 15.0—are relatively unstable and adversely impact widget functionality. The best way to fix that is by keeping iOS and iPadOS up to date.

 Related:[How to Update Your iPhone iOS, Apps, and Data Backups](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/)

 Start by heading over to**General** \>**Software Update** to scan for new system software updates. Follow that by tapping**Download and Install** to apply them.

 You can also activate automatic system-software updates for your iPhone. To do that, tap**Automatic Updates** (on the same screen) and turn on the switches next to**Download iOS Updates** and**Install iOS Updates** .

## 4\. Change the System Language

 If widgets still fail to load, consider trying out this unusual fix that involves briefly changing the system language on your iPhone or iPad.

 Head over to**Settings** \>**General** \>**Language & Region** . Then, tap**Other Languages** and pick a different language. That should automatically restart the device.

 Follow this by switching back to your preferred language and double-check your widgets to see if they've started working correctly.

Close

 Another fix that can resolve issues with malfunctioning widgets requires making the text bold on your iPhone or iPad.

 To do that, simply go to**Settings** \>**General** \>**Display & Brightness** and turn on the switch next to**Bold Text** . In case that helps, disable the bold text and check if the issue recurs.

## 5\. Disable Low Data Mode and Low Power Mode

[Low Data Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-low-data-mode-iphone-ipad/) and [Low Power Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-low-power-mode/) can impair widget-related activity. Try disabling them and check if that helps.

### How to Disable Low Data Mode: Cellular

 If you use cellular data for internet connectivity, go to**Settings** \>**Cellular** \>**Cellular Data Options** and turn off the switch next to**Low Data Mode** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### How to Disable Low Data Mode: Wi-Fi

 iOS and iPadOS apply Low Data Mode for Wi-Fi on a per-connection basis. So head over to**Settings** \>**Wi-Fi** , select your active Wi-Fi connection, and deactivate the switch next to**Low Data Mode** .

### How to Disable Low Power Mode

 To disable Low Power Mode, head over to**Settings** \>**Battery** and turn off the switch next to**Low Power Mode** .

## 6\. Check System Settings for Apps

 If a specific widget has trouble presenting up-to-date information, check if Location Services and [Background App Refresh](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-background-app-refresh/) are set up for the relevant app.

### How to Check Location Services

 Open the**Settings** app and go to**Privacy** \>**Location Services** . Then, tap the relevant app and select**While Using the App or Widgets** or**Always** . That should allow the app (and its widget) to display data based on location.

Close

### How to Check Background App Refresh

 Open the**Settings** app and go to**General** \>**Background App Refresh** . Then, turn on the switch next to the app in question. That should allow the app (and its widget in turn) to refresh automatically in the background.

## 7\. Edit the Widget Preferences

 If a widget displays the wrong information, you must check if it's set up correctly.

 Taking the**Weather** widget as an example, start by long-pressing and selecting the**Edit Widget** option. You can then tap**My Location** to search for and pick the correct location. Follow that by tapping outside the widget area to save your changes.

## 8\. Remove and Re-add Widgets

 Removing and re-adding a widget that has loading or other issues can also help.

 To do that, long-press a widget and select**Remove Widget** . If it's part of a Smart Stack, select**Edit Widget** and tap the**Delete** icon instead.

 You can then re-add the widget via the widgets gallery. Just long-press a vacant area in the Today View or on the Home screen and tap the**Plus** icon at the top of the screen to bring it up. Then, locate the widget and tap**Add Widget** .

## 9\. Reinstall Related Apps

 If the issue is restricted to a specific widget, you should try re-installing the relevant app. You can do that without losing any app-related data by offloading it.

 Go to**Settings** \>**General** \>**iPhone Storage** . Then, pick the app you want to remove and tap**Offload App** . Follow that by reinstalling the app via the App Store.

## 10\. Reset Network or All Settings

 Try resetting the network settings on your iPhone. If that fails, you must reset all settings on your iOS device. That helps fix network-related and other underlying issues preventing widgets from functioning correctly.

 To do that, go to**Settings** \>**General** \>**Transfer or Reset iPhone** \>**Reset** and use the**Reset Network Settings** and the**Reset All Settings** options.

## Fixed: Widgets Working Correctly Again

 Keeping both the apps and the system software up-to-date is the best way to minimize widget-related issues going forward. Also, don't forget to check any widget-specific settings to ensure that everything's been set up correctly.

 Now that you've managed to get your widgets functioning correctly, you may want to spend some time spicing up your iPhone with custom transparent widgets.
