## How to Restore Location Services When They Disappear From Your iPhone Screen

 Do you keep seeing "Location Not Available" while tracking a friend or family member's location in iMessage or Find My on your iPhone? It's an issue that's pretty easy to resolve. However, you may need to ask your friend or family member to take action on their device as well.

 So without any further ado, let's check out what it takes to fix the "Location Not Available" error on an iPhone. We'll start with the steps you can try yourself, before moving onto what the person you're trying to track needs to do.

## How to Fix "Location Not Available" From Your Own iPhone

 There isn't a lot you can do yourself if Messages or the Find My app says "Location Not Available" when someone has chosen to [share their iPhone location with you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-location-iphone/) . But it's still easiest to try these steps first, before involving somebody else.

### Quit and Relaunch Find My or Messages

 Sometimes, the Messages or the Find My app can bug out and result in the "Location Not Available" error. The quickest way to resolve that is to [force quit and relaunch the app](https://www.makeuseof.com/close-apps-on-ipad-iphone/) in question.

To force quit Messages or Find My:

1. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to invoke the App Switcher. If you have an iPhone with a Home button, press the**Home** button twice instead.
2. Locate the**Messages** or**Find My** card and push it off the top of the screen to close it.
3. Now go back to the Home screen and open Messages or Find My again.

### Restart the iPhone

 The simplest method is to go to**Settings > General > Shut Down** . Then, press and hold the**Side** or**Top** button to restart the iPhone.

### Check the Date and Time

 An incorrect date or time can create issues with location sharing. To check this, go to**Settings > General > Date & Time** . If the date or time is wrong, turn on the switch next to**Set Automatically** to get the correct date and time from Apple's servers. If this doesn't help, deactivate the switch and set the correct time manually.

### Switch to Cellular Data

 Spotty Wi-Fi can also play a factor, so try using cellular or mobile data instead. To do that, open the iPhone's**Control Center** (swipe down from the top-right of the screen or swipe up from the bottom if your iPhone has a Home button) and tap the**Wi-Fi** icon to disable it.

 If cellular data is active, the iPhone should automatically start using it. If not, tap the**Cellular** icon to activate it. Just make sure you don't have any [cellular data problems on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-cellular-data-not-working-fixes/) as well.
