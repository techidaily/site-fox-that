## How Often Should You Restart Your iPhone?

 The opinion on this varies from person to person. Some people don't restart their devices for weeks, while others frequently restart them. Most users perform a restart when their [iPhone feels slow](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-slow-iphone/) , their [iPhone apps keep crashing](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-ios-apps-keep-crashing-try-fixes/) , and the overall performance feels sluggish.

 For the best iPhone experience, you should restart your iPhone at least once every week. If you do it every three days, that's even better. This gives the device a chance to shut down and cool off. Plus, temporary files are cleared, minor issues are fixed automatically, and you'll probably face fewer situations where you need to [force stop apps on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-force-stop-apps-on-your-phone/) .
