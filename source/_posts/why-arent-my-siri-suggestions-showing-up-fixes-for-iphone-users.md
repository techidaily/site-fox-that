## Why Aren't My Siri Suggestions Showing Up? Fixes for iPhone Users

 If you own an iPhone, Siri is your best friend. It can schedule emails, set reminders, send text messages, initiate phone calls, and even give suggestions based on your iPhone usage.

 Depending on Siri is unavoidable if you use it for these tasks. But what happens if Siri suggestions stop popping up on your iPhone? No worries, because we have a few fixes you can try.

## Check Siri & Search Settings

 One reason why Siri suggestions won't pop up is if your Siri settings are configured incorrectly. So, the first step is to head to your Siri & Search settings to check if it has been turned off. Even if it's turned on, toggle it off and on to troubleshoot the issue.

 To check Siri & Search settings, head to**Settings** on your device, scroll down, and tap**Siri & Search** . Toggle**Show Suggestions** on, and if you see the option to**Reset Hidden Suggestions** right below, tap on it to restore suggestions you've previouly hidden.

## Restart Your iPhone

 If your Siri suggestions are still not popping up, you can restart your iPhone to troubleshoot it. However, your iPhone doesn't have a restart option, so you'll have to power off your iPhone and turn it back on.

 The buttons you need to press to do this may vary depending on the model, but it's easy to [restart any iPhone, even if the buttons are broken](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) .

## Get the Best of Siri Suggestions

 Siri suggestions make it easy to start a search the moment you swipe down on your Home Screen. In fact, you wouldn't need to type anything in Spotlight search to launch your favorite app, as Siri would've already suggested it for you.

 However, if none of these solutions worked in your favor, you can contact Apple Support or visit a nearby Apple Store for in-person assistance.
