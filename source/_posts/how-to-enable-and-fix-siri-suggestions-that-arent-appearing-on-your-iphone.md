## How to Enable and Fix Siri Suggestions That Aren't Appearing on Your iPhone

 If you own an iPhone, Siri is your best friend. It can schedule emails, set reminders, send text messages, initiate phone calls, and even give suggestions based on your iPhone usage.

 Depending on Siri is unavoidable if you use it for these tasks. But what happens if Siri suggestions stop popping up on your iPhone? No worries, because we have a few fixes you can try.

## Check Siri & Search Settings

 One reason why Siri suggestions won't pop up is if your Siri settings are configured incorrectly. So, the first step is to head to your Siri & Search settings to check if it has been turned off. Even if it's turned on, toggle it off and on to troubleshoot the issue.

 To check Siri & Search settings, head to**Settings** on your device, scroll down, and tap**Siri & Search** . Toggle**Show Suggestions** on, and if you see the option to**Reset Hidden Suggestions** right below, tap on it to restore suggestions you've previouly hidden.

## Check if Your iPhone Is Updated

 Apple frequently releases new software updates, which usually contain bug fixes for issues you might face. So if you haven't updated your iPhone,[getting the latest iOS version](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/) can resolve your Siri issues.

 Head to**Settings > General >** **Software Update** to see if a newer iOS version is available. If you have one, follow the prompts to update your iPhone.

## Restart Your iPhone

 If your Siri suggestions are still not popping up, you can restart your iPhone to troubleshoot it. However, your iPhone doesn't have a restart option, so you'll have to power off your iPhone and turn it back on.
