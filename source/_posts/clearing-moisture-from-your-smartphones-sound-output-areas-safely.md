 Although you're not supposed to take your iPhone into the shower or for a swim, many users do so anyway, causing water to get into the speaker. Fortunately, there are several free, simple ways to get water out of your iPhone's speakers.

## Use the Water Eject Shortcut on Your iPhone

 First, make sure you have the Shortcuts app on your iPhone. Shortcuts is a native Apple app, so if you haven't got it, simply download it for free from the App Store.

**Download:** [Shortcuts](http://apps.apple.com/app/shortcuts/id915249334) (Free)

 Next, get the [handy iPhone shortcut](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-shortcuts-automate/) called [Water Eject](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8632a30b2b814c4c914983351bb8a856) . On the webpage, tap**Add Shortcut** to download it to the Shortcuts app.

Close

After successfully adding the shortcut, here's how to use it:

1. Open the Shortcuts app and head to the**Shortcuts** tab.
2. Tap the**Water Eject** shortcut to run it.
3. Select**Start** .
4. You will be asked to**Select Intensity Level** . Choose what you see fit according to how much water might have gotten into your iPhone speaker. The maximum intensity gives better results.
5. You will now see the volume bar on the left side of the screen. The volume will be at 100% and your iPhone will begin emitting a specific sound to eject water from its speakers.

Close

 When the water ejection is complete, you will hear a "ding" sound. At this point, the shortcut will prompt you to connect to the Wikimedia site. Tap**Don't Allow** .

 You can opt to add the shortcut to your Home Screen if you want quick access in case of an emergency. Tap the**three dots** icon on the Water Eject shortcut, tap the**Share** icon (a box with an arrow), and select**Add to Home Screen** .

 The Sonic app lets you adjust the frequency of the sound; you can choose from 0Hz all the way to 25kHz. After setting the frequency, tap the**Start** button in the**Cleaner** tab to begin ejecting water from your iPhone's speakers.

**Download:** [Sonic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sonic-tone-generator/id986999895?platform=iphone) (Free, in-app purchases available)

 If you prefer not to download a shortcut or app on your device, you can head to the [Fix My Speakers site](https://fixmyspeakers.com/) to play the tone needed to eject water from your iPhone's speakers. Just tap the button with the wind and water droplets emoji to activate the sound.

## What to Avoid When Your iPhone Speaker Is Wet

 Your iPhone's speakers get wet when you accidentally drop the device in water. When you're attempting to [save a wet smartphone or tablet](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-save-a-wet-cell-phone-or-tablet/) , you might instantly think of the method where people put their devices in rice to dry them.

 However, that is merely a myth. In fact, the tiny particles may get into your iPhone and cause other damage. That's just one of the reasons [why you shouldn't use rice to dry your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/rice-doesnt-fix-water-damage/) . Also, don't use your iPhone until it's completely dry.

 If it's not a severe case, the Water Eject shortcut, Sonic app, or Fix My Speaker site should easily help you get rid of water from your iPhone's speakers. In the future, remember that your iPhone is only water-resistant, not waterproof, so you shouldn't submerge it in the pool, drop it in the sink, or expose it to other water activities.

 Unfortunately, if your iPhone is already showing multiple [symptoms of water damage](https://www.makeuseof.com/symptoms-of-water-damaged-iphone/) , it's best to take it to a nearby Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for hardware repairs.
