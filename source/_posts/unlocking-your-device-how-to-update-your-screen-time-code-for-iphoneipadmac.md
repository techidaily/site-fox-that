### On a Mac

 Here's what you need to do if you'd like to reset the Screen Time passcode for your child's device using your Mac:

1. Click the**Apple logo** and go to**System Settings** .
2. Select**Screen Time** from the sidebar on the left.

6. Now, type in a new Screen Time passcode and enter it again to confirm.

 It's that easy! However, if you also forgot your Apple account login details, you'll have to go through the complicated process of [resetting your Apple ID password](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/forgot-apple-id-icloud-password/) first.

 If you have enabled**Share Across Devices** , your Screen Time settings will sync seamlessly across all devices under your iCloud account. This means you won't have to individually change the Screen Time passcode on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
