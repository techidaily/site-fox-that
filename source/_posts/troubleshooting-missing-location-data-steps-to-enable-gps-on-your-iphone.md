## Troubleshooting Missing Location Data: Steps to Enable GPS on Your iPhone

 Do you keep seeing "Location Not Available" while tracking a friend or family member's location in iMessage or Find My on your iPhone? It's an issue that's pretty easy to resolve. However, you may need to ask your friend or family member to take action on their device as well.

 So without any further ado, let's check out what it takes to fix the "Location Not Available" error on an iPhone. We'll start with the steps you can try yourself, before moving onto what the person you're trying to track needs to do.

## How to Fix "Location Not Available" From Your Own iPhone

 There isn't a lot you can do yourself if Messages or the Find My app says "Location Not Available" when someone has chosen to [share their iPhone location with you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-location-iphone/) . But it's still easiest to try these steps first, before involving somebody else.

### Quit and Relaunch Find My or Messages

 Sometimes, the Messages or the Find My app can bug out and result in the "Location Not Available" error. The quickest way to resolve that is to [force quit and relaunch the app](https://www.makeuseof.com/close-apps-on-ipad-iphone/) in question.

To force quit Messages or Find My:

1. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to invoke the App Switcher. If you have an iPhone with a Home button, press the**Home** button twice instead.
2. Locate the**Messages** or**Find My** card and push it off the top of the screen to close it.
3. Now go back to the Home screen and open Messages or Find My again.

Close

### Restart Your iPhone

 If closing and reopening the relevant app didn't work, you might need to [restart your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) instead. To restart your iPhone, simply open the**Settings** app and tap**General > Shut Down** . Once the screen goes black, wait for several seconds and hold the**Side** or the**Top** button until you see the Apple logo.

## How to Fix "Location Not Available" From Someone Else's iPhone

 If the two fixes above didn't help, you'll need to shift your attention to your friend or family member's iPhone. Walk them through the fixes below on a call. Or, share this post with them and make sure they follow the instructions in this section.

### Toggle Share My Location Off and On

 Disabling and re-enabling Share My Location in the Find My preferences can help an iPhone broadcast its location again. To do that, go to**Settings** and tap the person's name at the top of the screen, then select**Find My** . Toggle the switch next to**Share My Location** off and then on.

### Share the Location in Messages and Find My Again

 Next, disable and re-enable location sharing in the Messages or Find My app:

* **In Messages:** Open a chat with the person you want to share your location with. Tap the profile picture at the top of the chat and select**Stop Sharing My Location** . Now hit**Share My Location** .
* **In Find My:** Switch to the**People** tab, tap the name of the person you want to share your location with and select**Stop Sharing My Location** . Then, go back to the**People** tab, tap the**Add (+)** icon,**Share My Location** , and choose a contact.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Check the Date and Time

 An incorrect date or time can create issues with location sharing. To check this, go to**Settings > General > Date & Time** . If the date or time is wrong, turn on the switch next to**Set Automatically** to get the correct date and time from Apple's servers. If this doesn't help, deactivate the switch and set the correct time manually.

### Switch to Cellular Data

 Spotty Wi-Fi can also play a factor, so try using cellular or mobile data instead. To do that, open the iPhone's**Control Center** (swipe down from the top-right of the screen or swipe up from the bottom if your iPhone has a Home button) and tap the**Wi-Fi** icon to disable it.

 If cellular data is active, the iPhone should automatically start using it. If not, tap the**Cellular** icon to activate it. Just make sure you don't have any [cellular data problems on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-cellular-data-not-working-fixes/) as well.

## Sharing Your Location Isn't Always Wise

 Location tracking can be a double-edged sword. Although it enables valuable features such as location sharing in iMessage and Find My, various third-party apps and services can also use your location for nefarious purposes. Learn what you can do to find and disable unwanted location tracking on your iPhone to protect your privacy while taking advantage of this feature.
