### Restart the iPhone

 The simplest method is to go to**Settings > General > Shut Down** . Then, press and hold the**Side** or**Top** button to restart the iPhone.

### Check the Date and Time

 An incorrect date or time can create issues with location sharing. To check this, go to**Settings > General > Date & Time** . If the date or time is wrong, turn on the switch next to**Set Automatically** to get the correct date and time from Apple's servers. If this doesn't help, deactivate the switch and set the correct time manually.

### Switch to Cellular Data

 Spotty Wi-Fi can also play a factor, so try using cellular or mobile data instead. To do that, open the iPhone's**Control Center** (swipe down from the top-right of the screen or swipe up from the bottom if your iPhone has a Home button) and tap the**Wi-Fi** icon to disable it.

 If cellular data is active, the iPhone should automatically start using it. If not, tap the**Cellular** icon to activate it. Just make sure you don't have any [cellular data problems on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-cellular-data-not-working-fixes/) as well.

## Sharing Your Location Isn't Always Wise

 Location tracking can be a double-edged sword. Although it enables valuable features such as location sharing in iMessage and Find My, various third-party apps and services can also use your location for nefarious purposes. Learn what you can do to find and disable unwanted location tracking on your iPhone to protect your privacy while taking advantage of this feature.
