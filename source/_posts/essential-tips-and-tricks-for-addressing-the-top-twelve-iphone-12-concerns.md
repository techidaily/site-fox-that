## Essential Tips & Tricks for Addressing the Top Twelve iPhone 12 Concerns

 Owners of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are generally quite happy with the device. From camera results to intensive gaming and processing, the overall performance of this device makes it worth a shot.

 However, you may experience some issues with iPhone 12 at some point in life. Fortunately, most of these issues are fixable. So, before you consider investing in a new phone, let's dig deeper into the biggest iPhone 12 issues and see how to fix them.

## 1\. No SIM or Invalid SIM Error on iPhone 12

 Thanks to Wi-Fi, many people forget the existence of SIM cards. What's the point of dialing from your phone if you are getting facilities to call and message people without extra charges?

 You might not notice that your iPhone has lost the SIM connection until it's actually needed. iPhone 12 might lose its connection to a SIM card due to a glitch in an update, a damaged SIM or port, improper tray placement, or a malfunction in the iOS system.

Before taking it to the nearest Apple Store, try these steps:

![Airplane mode on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-on-iPhone-1.JPG)

![Airplane mode off](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-off-1.JPG)

Close

1. Confirm that your SIM card is active and ready to use.
2. Activate Airplane Mode on the phone and turn it off. Your iPhone 12 should start catching signals.
3. If enabling/disabling Airplane Mode doesn't fix your problem, turn off the phone and take out your SIM tray.
4. Examine your SIM to confirm if there's any damage or not.
5. Put the SIM with the SIM tray back in the phone.
6. Restart your iPhone 12\. It should show mobile signals now.

 You may need to update iOS if the above method doesn't work. You can do so by going to**Settings > General > Software Update** on your iPhone. But if that doesn't solve the issue either, replace the SIM or get it inserted by a professional.

 If none of the steps seem to work, your SIM port is probably busted and might need repair by a professional.

## 2\. Problems With Face ID on iPhone 12

 iPhone 12 is one of the newer models that support Apple's face recognition system. It is an additional security step that lets you unlock the phone and authorize different transactions on the device.

 Users might experience issues because of improper lighting or objects near the face when [setting up Face ID on the iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/set-up-face-id-on-iphone-ipad/) . If you cannot unlock your phone, clean the sensors (or the entire screen) with a soft microfiber cloth.

 You can also reset your Face ID. To do that, follow these simple instructions:

![Face ID in iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Face-ID-in-iPhone.JPG)

![Enter passcode on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Enter-passcode-on-iPhone.JPG)

![Face ID settings in iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Face-ID-settings-in-iPhone.JPG)

![Reset Face ID](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Reset-Face-ID.JPG)

Close

1. Go to**Settings** and scroll down until you see**Face ID & Passcode** .
2. Enter your passcode and toggle any disabled tabs mentioned under the**Use Face ID** section.
3. If that doesn't work, tap**Reset Face ID** and**Setup Face ID** .
4. Adjust the**Attention Awareness** features as desired. Enabling them adds an extra security layer and does not unlock the phone unless you are facing the screen.

 Usually, it is just a permission-related issue, but you have the option to reset it if needed.

## 3\. iPhone 12 Audio Issues

 Some iPhone 12 users might come across audio issues. Remember that it's a temporary problem and super easy to fix within a couple of steps. Press the**Ringer** button (left of the iPhone above the Volume buttons) upwards to activate sounds.

![Ringer button of iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ringer-button-of-iPhone.jpg)

 Once the ringer is turned ON, here's what you need to do on your iPhone:

![General iPhone settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/General-iPhone-Settings-1.JPG)

![Ringtone and alert volume](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ringtone-and-alert-volume.JPG)

Close

1. Open**Settings** and tap**Sounds & Haptics** .

Close

 This might be the most annoying iPhone 12 issue on the list because some users might experience connectivity issues, especially when connecting with a non-iOS device. Try fixing this problem by bringing both gadgets up close.

 If it still doesn't work, turn off Bluetooth on both devices and turn it back on. Also, make sure both devices are visible and available for pairing. If the problem persists, you should get your device checked.

## 5\. Wi-Fi Connection Problems With iPhone 12

 Using your iPhone without a stable Wi-Fi connection is a bit challenging. A poor connection or out-of-range Wi-Fi might be the top reasons your phone isn't connecting to the network. Apart from this, limited data plans or router issues may also lead to connectivity concerns.

To fix the Wi-Fi problem, you can try the following steps:

2. Change your internet connection to a faster/more stable one.
3. Restart your iPhone, update iOS (if available), and then try relaunching the iTunes Store app or App Store.
