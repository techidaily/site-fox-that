## Mastering the Art of Fixing iPhones: Tackling 7 Common Camera Challenges

 You wouldn't buy a new smartphone if it didn't have a camera on it. So what good is your iPhone when the camera isn't working?

 Here are the most common problems you might come across with your iPhone camera, along with everything you can do to fix them.

## 1\. iPhone Camera Shows a Black Screen

 If you launch the Camera app and see a black screen, try the following steps to fix it:

1. Make sure nothing is blocking the camera lens. You may have put the case on incorrectly or there may be something stuck to the back of your iPhone.
2. Try using the official iPhone Camera app, rather than any third-party alternatives. This app is more reliable than the alternatives and more likely to work properly.
3. In the Camera app, switch between the front and back cameras to see if both of them are working or not. To do this, tap the camera flip icon on the right side of the screen. If only one camera works, that might indicate a hardware problem.
4. Restart the Camera app. To do so, swipe up to the middle of the screen on an iPhone X or later, or double-click the Home button on an iPhone 8 or earlier. Then close the Camera app by sliding it off the top of the screen.
5. Turn off your iPhone by holding the Side button (along with either Volume button on the iPhone X and later), then slide to power off. Wait 30 seconds before pressing the Side button again to restart your iPhone. If that doesn't work,[force restart your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restart-iphone-recovery-mode/) instead.

## 2\. iPhone Photos Are Blurry or Out of Focus

 If the photos you take with your iPhone camera are blurry or out of focus, try these fixes:

1. Make sure both the front and back camera lenses are clean. Wipe away smudges or fingerprints using a dry microfiber cloth. If you see dirt or debris behind the glass, take your iPhone to an Apple Store or Authorized Service Provider for a repair.
2. Remove any metallic or magnetic iPhone cases and camera accessories. They can interfere with the optical image stabilization on an iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone X, or later iPhones. This might explain why the camera isn't working.
3. If the Camera app says**AE/AF Lock** at the top of the screen, tap on a blank space to turn auto-focus back on. You may have accidentally locked the focus by tapping and holding in the Camera app.
4. Keep your hand steady while tapping the shutter button. Sometimes it's easier to press one of the Volume buttons to take steady pictures instead. Be careful in the dark when the shutter needs to stay open for longer.

## 3\. iPhone Camera Flash Isn't Working

![iPhone Flashlight Control Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ios-control-center.png)

 Although most photos look better without a flash, sometimes you need that extra light for dark environments. When your iPhone flash isn't working, try these tips:

1. Test the LED on your iPhone by [turning on the flashlight](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-on-flashlight-turn-off-flashlight/) from the Control Center.
2. Make sure you set the flash to**On** or**Auto** in the Camera app. To do this, tap the lightning bolt icon on the left side of the screen to see your flash options (you can't use the flash for panoramic photographs or time-lapse videos).
3. Be careful when using the flash for long videos or in hot environments. If your iPhone gets too hot, it might disable the flash entirely until it has cooled down again.

## 4\. iPhone Photos Are Flipped the Wrong Way

 This problem can often happen when you turn your iPhone horizontally to take a landscape-oriented photo. After snapping the picture, it flips back to portrait orientation in your photo library. Try these tips to fix it:

1. Open Control Center on your iPhone and tap the lock icon with a circle around it to turn off Rotation Lock.  
   1. To open Control Center, swipe down from the top-right corner on an iPhone X or later, or swipe up from the bottom of the screen on an iPhone 8 or earlier.
2. Before snapping a photo, take a moment to make sure that the icons in the Camera app have rotated to their new horizontal orientation. If not, rotate your iPhone back and forth until they do so.
3. You can always edit your pictures later from the Photos app, or other [third-party iPhone image editing apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-free-photo-editing-apps-iphone/) .
4. If you're wondering why your selfies always appear mirrored, that's simply how Apple designed the front-facing camera. The camera works like a mirror, but the photo flips over as if someone took it for you.

## 5\. The Camera App Is Missing or Keeps Freezing

 If you can't find the Camera app on your Home screen, or if the app freezes when you switch between cameras, it may be due to your iPhone restrictions. You can check this out from the Screen Time settings:

1. Go to **Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions** .
2. Tap on**Allowed Apps** and enter your Screen Time passcode if you have one.
3. Make sure you turn the**Camera** app on; the toggle should be green.
