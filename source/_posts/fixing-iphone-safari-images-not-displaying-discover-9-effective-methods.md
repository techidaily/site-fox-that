 Let's start with a basic solution. Your unstable internet connection could be why Safari can't load images on your iPhone. Safari requires a stable internet connection to work properly.

 You can check the speed of your cellular data or Wi-Fi connection by visiting one of the many [speed test websites](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) available. If your cellular connectivity seems poor on your iPhone, enable Airplane Mode for a few seconds and then turn it off to refresh your network or switch to a Wi-Fi network.

## 2\. Force Quit and Relaunch Safari

 If your internet works fine, another simple fix for solving images not loading on Safari would be to force quit the app and relaunch it. With this method, you can easily fix any minor bug or glitch that might be preventing Safari from loading images on your iPhone.

 Swipe up and hold to reveal the background app on your iPhone's Home Screen. Look for the Safari app and swipe up to force close the app.

 You can also try a different browser to see if the website you're trying to open loads correctly on it. It could be an issue with the website and not Safari, or maybe that website isn't compatible with Safari.

## 3\. Disable Low Data Mode

 Using your iPhone in Low Data Mode may help reduce overall cellular data usage by limiting the data your iPhone can access for background tasks.

 Still, it can also prevent images from loading on Safari. Turning off this feature can fix the images not loading in Safari issue.

 Here's what you need to do to enable Low Data Mode for a cellular connection:

1. Launch the**Settings** app on your iPhone and select**Cellular** .
2. Tap**Cellular Data Options** .
3. Toggle off**Low Data Mode** .

Close

Now, relaunch Safari and see if it loads images as intended.

## 4\. Enable JavaScript

 JavaScript is widely used on websites to display images and other dynamic elements. If you accidentally turned off the JavaScript option in Safari settings, this could be why images aren't loading in Safari on your iPhone. To fix this, follow these steps:

1. Open the**Settings** app on your iPhone and select**Safari** .
2. Tap the**Advanced** option at the bottom.
3. Enable the**JavaScript** toggle.

Now, check if you're able to load images while browsing Safari.

## 5\. Disable Ad Blockers

 There's no denying that ad blockers are tremendously helpful in removing unwanted ads from a webpage and improving the overall browsing experience.

 While these extensions can [improve your Safari experience](https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-to-improve-safari-experience-on-iphone/) , they may result in photos not loading in Safari on your iPhone. To solve this, disable these ad blockers by following these instructions:

1. Open the**Settings** app on your iPhone and select**Safari** .
2. Under the**General** section, tap the**Extension** option.

## 6\. Remove Content Restrictions

 To remove content restrictions for Safari on your iPhone, here's what you need to do:

1. Launch the**Settings** app and select**Screen Time** .
2. Tap**Content & Privacy Restrictions** .
3. Disable the**Content & Privacy Restrictions** toggle.

1. Head to the**Settings** app and select**Safari** .
2. Scroll down and tap on**Clear History and Website Data** .
3. Select**All history** and hit the red**Clear History** button.

## 8\. Disconnect Your VPN

 VPNs are a fantastic way to hide your location and other private information from websites you visit. However, VPNs usually re-route your data through a succession of remote servers to keep it untraceable, producing network latency that can prevent pictures from loading in Safari.

 Disconnecting the VPN might solve the issue if you're using a VPN while browsing Safari. You can either do this directly from the VPN app installed on your iPhone or go to**Settings > VPN** and toggle of**VPN Status** .

## 9\. Update Your iPhone

 iOS updates can sometimes carry bugs that could affect certain apps, but Apple is always quick to address such issues. So, if you haven't updated your iPhone in a while, now would be the right time to do so.
