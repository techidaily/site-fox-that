 Do you keep receiving a "Last Line No Longer Available" error while attempting to place a call on your iPhone? You're not alone, as several iOS users have come across the same issue.

 Below, we'll briefly discuss what this error means, why it shows up on your iPhone, and teach you everything you can do to get rid of it. So, let's get started, shall we?

## What Does the "Last Line No Longer Available" Error on iPhone Mean?

 An iPhone on a Dual SIM setup can display a "Last Line No Longer Available" error when it has trouble detecting the default or preferred line while attempting to make a phone call. It mainly appears on [the various iPhone 13 models](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-all-iphone-13-models/) but can also be a problem on other [dual SIM-supported iPhone models](https://www.makeuseof.com/which-iphone-models-support-dual-sim/) , including the new iPhone 14.

 The underlying reason is some random bug or glitch with the cellular radio, a corrupt call log, or an incorrectly configured network setting. You can still use your other number, but that's not always practical.

 Usually, fixes like toggling Airplane Mode on and off, restarting your iPhone, or clearing your "Recents" history help resolve the issue. However, you may have to resort to performing a carrier settings update or a network reset if none of the more straightforward fixes help.

 Let's go through each possible way to fix the "Last Line No Longer Available" iPhone error.

## 1\. Switch Phone Lines Manually on iPhone

 Tapping the**Call** option on the "Last Line No Longer Available" pop-up automatically puts the call through the other line on your iPhone. If that doesn't work as well, try switching numbers manually.

* While dialing a new number, tap the current line at the top of the screen and pick the other line.
* While placing a call from the "Favorites" and "Recents" lists, tap the**Info** button and choose the number you want.

 If you do not want to use the alternative line on your iPhone, continue with the potential fixes below.

## 2\. Toggle Airplane Mode On and Off on iPhone

 Enabling and disabling [Airplane Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-airplane-mode/) is a quick fix for most cellular connectivity issues on the iPhone. Just bring up the Control Center (swipe down from the top-right of the screen or double-click the**Home** button) and tap the**Airplane Mode** icon. After waiting 10 seconds, tap the icon once more.

## 3\. Restart Your iPhone

 Another quick way to fix the "Last Line No Longer" available error requires that you reboot your iPhone. Since iOS does not feature a "Restart" option, you must turn off the device and manually boot it back up.

 To do that, open the**Settings** app and go to**General** \>**Shut Down** . Then, swipe the**Power** icon to the right, wait until the screen goes fully dark, and hold the**Side** button until you see the Apple logo.

## 4\. Clear Your iPhone's Call History

1. Open the**Phone** app and switch to the**Recents** tab.
2. Tap**Edit** .
3. Tap the**Delete** icon next to each entry related to the contact or number.

 Delete the entire call log if the error occurs for every number on your iPhone's "Recents" list. To do that:

## 5\. Update the Carrier Settings on iPhone

 Check if your iPhone has a pending carrier update. To do that, open the**Settings** app and tap**General** \>**About** . Then, scroll down to the**Carrier** section and wait for up to a minute. If you get a "Carrier Update Available" prompt, tap**Update** to install it.

## 6\. Avoid Using Your Preferred Line for Cellular Data

 The "Last Line No Longer Available" error can also show up on your iPhone if you use your default or preferred line to access cellular data. You can change that by following these steps:

1. Open the**Settings** app and tap**Cellular** .
2. Tap**Cellular Data** .
3. Select the other phone line or**Off** to disable cellular data altogether.

## 7\. Disable Automatic Network Selection on iPhone

 Another reason for the "Last Line No Longer Available" iPhone error is a feature called Automatic Network Selection. It prompts your iPhone to pick the best network to establish a connection but causes issues on Dual-SIM iPhones.

 To disable Automatic Network Selection, open the**Settings** app and tap**Cellular** \>**Network Selection** . Then, turn off the switch next to**Automatic Network Selection** and pick your carrier network.

## 8\. Disable Wi-Fi Calling on iPhone

[Wi-Fi Calling](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-wifi-calling-works/) allows you to make and receive phone calls over Wi-Fi in areas with poor cellular signal strength, but it could also create conflicts and result in the "Last Line No Longer Available" error.

 To fix that, open the**Settings** app and tap**Cellular** \>**Wi-Fi Calling** . Then, turn off the switch next to**Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone** .

## 9\. Install the Latest Software Updates

 Apple regularly pushes software updates to iPhones in order to address issues like this. So, a newer software version might contain a permanent fix for the "Last Line No Longer Available" error. To check, open the**Settings** app and go to**General** \>**Software Update** . Then, tap**Download & Install** to install the latest available version of iOS for your iPhone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 10\. Reset Network Settings on iPhone

 If none of the fixes above work, try [resetting your iPhone's network settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-iphone/) . To do that, open the**Settings** app, go to**General** \>**Transfer & Reset Phone** \>**Reset** \>**Reset Network Settings** .

 A network settings reset wipes your iPhone's cellular settings and preferences, but they should automatically update after the device reboots itself. Contact your carrier if they don't.

 Resetting the network settings on your iPhone deletes all the saved Wi-Fi hotspots and passwords. You must manually rejoin any networks afterward.

## Say Goodbye to the "Last Line No Longer Available" Error

 Turning Airplane Mode on and off, restarting your iPhone, or clearing your "Recents" list almost always fixes the "Last Line No Longer Available" error. If not, take the time to go through the other fixes above, and it should eventually go away.

 However, if the problem persists, the only remaining option is to contact your carrier or Apple Support for help. But don't worry; they can help you in more ways than we could.
