## 1\. Test the Camera and Microphone on Your Device

 If people can't see or hear you on FaceTime, there might be a problem with the camera or microphones on your device.

 On your iPhone, the simplest way to test this is to open the Camera app and record a short video of yourself talking into the front-facing camera. On a Mac, use the Photo Booth app for this.

 Play the video back to find out if there are any problems with the audio or video you recorded. You'll need to [troubleshoot your iPhone's camera issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-camera-not-working/) first if so.

## 2\. Turn On Your Camera and Microphone in FaceTime

![FaceTime controls on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FaceTime-controls-on-iPhone.jpg)

 If people can't see or hear you on FaceTime, it could be because you've accidentally disabled your camera or microphone for that call.

 During a FaceTime call, reveal more controls by tapping the screen on an iPhone or iPad or hovering your mouse over the FaceTime window on a Mac. Click the**Video** and**Microphone** icons to turn your camera or microphone on and off during the call.

 Similarly, if you can't see or hear the other person on FaceTime but they can see you, it's best to ask them to confirm if they have video and mic enabled on their end.

## 3\. Test the Internet Connection on Your Device

 Unlike regular phone calls, FaceTime needs an internet connection to work. If FaceTime isn't connecting, load a webpage on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to test the internet connection.

 FaceTime works best over Wi-Fi, but you can also use it with your cellular data on an iPhone or iPad. To use FaceTime without Wi-Fi, go to**Settings > Cellular** (or**Mobile Service**) and find**FaceTime** from the list. Toggle on the**FaceTime** slider to let it use cellular data.

## 4\. Restart Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac

 Restarting your device is one of the best troubleshooting tips for any app. When you [restart your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) or [reboot your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-restart-force-shut-down-mac/) , you'll often find that software glitches are resolved in the process. That's because the operating system is refreshed due to the device powering off and turning back on.

 It sounds simple, but don't overlook this useful step when FaceTime isn't working.

## 5\. Find Out if FaceTime Is Down for Everyone

![apple system status webpage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/apple-system-status-webpage.jpg)

 Apple services sometimes experience technical issues, which means FaceTime won't connect or be available for anyone. When this happens, there's nothing you can do but wait for Apple to implement a solution.

 Take a look at the current status of every Apple service on [Apple's System Status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) . If the status indicator next to FaceTime isn't green, it means the service is experiencing an outage and you'll need to wait.

## 6\. Check if FaceTime Works in Your Country

 Unfortunately, FaceTime isn't available worldwideâ€”although it certainly comes close. It also isn't available with every single network provider.

 Take a look at [Apple's carrier support page](https://support.apple.com/HT204039) to find out if your carrier supports FaceTime in your country. If FaceTime isn't available where you live, you might be able to bypass these limitations by using a [free VPN app for your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-vpn-iphone-ipad/) .

## 7\. Make Sure You Use the Right Contact Details

 On your iPhone, you can check your own FaceTime contact details by going to **Settings > FaceTime > You Can Be Reached By FaceTime At** . Ask the person you're calling to do the same to make sure you have the right details for them.

![iphone facetime settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iphone-facetime-settings.JPEG)

Close

 To check your details on a Mac, open the**FaceTime** app. From the menu bar, go to**FaceTime > Settings** . Your contact details will appear in the**General** tab.

## 8\. Confirm That Your Device Works With Group FaceTime

 You might not be able to [get Group FaceTime chats to work](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/group-facetime-mac-iphone/) if your device is too old. This could be the case even if one-to-one FaceTime calls work just fine.

For Group FaceTime chats, you need one of the following devices:

* iPhone 6s or later
* iPod touch (7th generation)
* iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad (5th generation), or later
* Any Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.3 or later

## 9\. Limit the People in Your Group FaceTime Chat

 FaceTime lets you start a group chat with up to 32 people at a time. But having that many people makes it difficult to know who is causing FaceTime problems. Try starting a one-to-one chat, then add extra people one at a time to find out when the problems start.

 If FaceTime doesn't connect for anyone at all, there must be an issue with your device or internet connection. However, if FaceTime isn't working with one person in particular, the problem probably lies at their end.

## 10\. Update the Software on Your Device

 FaceTime might run into issues if you aren't running the latest software on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Update your device to the latest OS release to fix this issue. Also, make sure the person you're trying to call updates their device as well.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > General > Software Update** . On a Mac, go to**System Settings > General > Software Update** to check for a newer version.

## 11\. Set the Date and Time Automatically

 Apple suggests you set the date and time automatically if FaceTime isn't working on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Most of us do this anyway, but you should ensure it's enabled in the settings on your device.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > General > Date & Time** and make sure**Set Automatically** is turned on.

Close

 On a Mac, go to**System Settings > General > Date & Time** . Toggle on**Set time and date automatically** at the top. You may need to click the padlock and enter your Mac's admin password to unlock changes first.

## 12\. Temporarily Disable FaceTime in Settings

 You can turn FaceTime off and on from the FaceTime settings menu on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You might need to sign back into your Apple ID account when you turn it on again.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > FaceTime** and toggle off**FaceTime** . Wait a few moments to toggle it on again.

![iphone facetime toggled off in settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iphone-facetime-toggled-off-in-settings.JPEG)

Close

 On a Mac, open the FaceTime app and go to**FaceTime > Settings** from the menu bar. Uncheck the**Enable this account** option to turn FaceTime off. Then click**Turn On** to enable it again.

## 13\. Sign Out of FaceTime, Then Sign In Again

 If FaceTime still isn't working on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, sign out entirely and then sign back in. You can [reset your Apple ID password](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/forgot-apple-id-icloud-password/) if you've forgotten it.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > FaceTime** . Tap your**Apple ID email address** under the**Caller ID** section and choose**Sign Out** from the popup that appears. After signing out, tap**Use your Apple ID for FaceTime** and sign in using your Apple ID details.

![sign out of facetime popup on iphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sign-out-of-facetime-popup-on-iphone.JPEG)

Close

 On a Mac, open the FaceTime app and go to**FaceTime > Settings** from the menu bar. Click**Sign Out** at the top of the window, then confirm you want to**Sign Out** . After signing out, enter your Apple ID details in the main FaceTime window to sign in again.

## 14\. Disable Content Restrictions for FaceTime

 If the FaceTime app is completely missing on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you may have enabled Screen Time restrictions. People typically use these settings to keep young children from accessing certain features on a device.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to **Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions** . Go into**Allowed Apps** and make sure the toggles for both**FaceTime** and**Camera** are enabled.

![allowed apps in iphone content and privacy restriction settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/allowed-apps-in-iphone-content-and-privacy-restriction-settings.JPEG)

Close

 On a Mac, go to**System Settings > Screen Time** **\>** **Content & Privacy > App Restrictions** . Ensure that**Camera** and**FaceTime** are enabled.

![app restrictions on mac](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/app-restrictions-on-mac.jpg)

 If prompted on either device, enter your Screen Time passcode, which usually differs from your device passcode.

## 15\. Enable Certain Ports in Your Firewall

 FaceTime may not work on a Mac if your computer firewall blocks the necessary connections. This can happen with third-party firewalls that aren't configured to work with FaceTime. You can fix these issues without disabling your firewall by opening particular ports.

 Check with whoever made your firewall to find out how to unblock particular ports. Then, take a look at [Apple's firewall support page](https://support.apple.com/HT202078) to find out which ports you need to unblock for FaceTime.

 When FaceTime works, it's marvelous. You can video call your friends and family with perfect clarity. With the troubleshooting tips above, you should be able to fix almost every FaceTime problem.

 However, if FaceTime still doesn't work, you can use an alternative app, such as WhatsApp or Messenger, for video calls in the meantime. These are free and work across multiple platforms. At the same time, you can contact Apple Support for further assistance.
