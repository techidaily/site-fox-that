## Troubleshooting Guide: How to Repair a Non-Responsive Control Center on iPhone

 The Control Center is a pretty neat feature that instantly gives you access to the essential controls on your iPhone. You can quickly access the connectivity options, control the volume, and adjust the brightness of your screen, among many other nitty-gritty features.

 Since it's so important, It can be a real bummer when the Control Center on your iPhone stops working. Below, we'll look at all the potential troubleshooting steps to fix this issue and bring all the crucial controls back to your fingertips.

## 1\. Clean Your iPhone's Screen

 Your iPhone's display not being able to register your touch inputs could be the reason you're unable to access the Control Center. It might be because you're using a thick protective case on your iPhone that might overlap your display, preventing you from accessing the Control Center.

 Besides this, the quality and condition of your screen protector can also be why you can't access the Control Center. So, if it has scratches or cracks on it, replace it with a new one. And even if you're not using your iPhone with a screen protector, its display isn't immune to dust and dirt that accumulate over time.

 Because of this, your screen's touch sensitivity and accuracy may reduce, making it unresponsive to touch. The best way to fix this issue is to remove the screen protector and [clean your iPhone's display](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/) with a microfiber cloth. And when you're done, see if you're able to open the Control Center.

## 2\. Turn Off VoiceOver

 For those unaware, VoiceOver is one of the many [accessibility features in iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/overview-of-all-accessibility-features-iphone/) that lets a visually impaired person interact with their iPhone. It's a gesture-based screen reader that gives an audio description of what's on the screen. Unfortunately, you can't access the Control Center when VoiceOver is active.

 So, if you accidentally activated this feature, you can turn it off by heading over to**Settings** \>**Accessibility** . Once you're here, tap**VoiceOver** and toggle off the switch at the top. Now, try opening the Control Center on your iPhone.
