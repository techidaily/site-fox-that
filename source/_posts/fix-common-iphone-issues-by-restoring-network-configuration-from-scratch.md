## What Happens When You Reset Your iPhone's Network Settings?

 When you reset your network settings, it will delete all network-related data stored on your device. This includes Wi-Fi passwords, saved Bluetooth connections, VPN information, and network preferences. They will all be restored to their default factory values, and your device will not remember any network names, login information, or paired devices.

 Once you reset network settings, you will manually have to enter login information and pair your devices once again.

 On the bright side, you won't lose any files, photos, texts, browsing history, or other important data on your iPhone, as a network reset is completely different from a factory reset. A factory reset wipes your iPhone, reverting it back to the state it was in before you used it. A network reset does this only for your network settings specifically.

 If you're worried about losing passwords and any cellular network settings, you can [back up your iPhone to iCloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-iphone-ipad/) before you proceed with the reset and then [restore your iPhone from a backup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restore-iphone-ipad-from-backup/) afterward.
