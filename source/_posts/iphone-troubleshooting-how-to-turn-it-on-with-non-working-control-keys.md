 If you're using iPhone SE (1st generation), 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, or earlier models, the steps are the same as above (for devices with the Home button). Just make sure to press the**Power button** on the top of the device instead.

## How to Restart an iPhone if the Buttons Are Broken or Not Working

 In the sections above, we detailed the steps to restart an iPhone using its physical buttons. However, there are two more methods you can use to restart your iPhone, and they don't involve using any buttons.

 This comes in handy if your iPhone buttons are broken or not working for any reason. It can also be helpful if you're unable to press and hold the buttons.

### How to Restart an iPhone From the Settings App

 The first method is to restart your iPhone through the**Settings** app. Follow these steps:

1. Go to**Settings** \>**General** and tap**Shut Down** .
2. Drag the power off slider to the right to turn off your iPhone.
3. Wait for at least 30 seconds.
4. Finally, to turn on your iPhone, plug it in to charge.

### How to Restart an iPhone Using Siri

 The second button-free method involves using Siri, the virtual assistant on your iPhone. However, this method requires an iPhone running iOS 16 or later. To use Siri to restart your device, follow these steps:

1. First,[set up Siri on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-and-use-siri-iphone/) .
2. Ensure that you have**Listen for "Hey Siri"** toggled on and that your iPhone is connected to the internet.
3. Say to your device clearly, "Hey Siri, restart my iPhone."
4. You'll see a pop-up on your screen. Tap**Restart** to confirm. Your iPhone will now turn off and turn on again all by itself.

## How Often Should You Restart Your iPhone?

 The opinion on this varies from person to person. Some people don't restart their devices for weeks, while others frequently restart them. Most users perform a restart when their [iPhone feels slow](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-slow-iphone/) , their [iPhone apps keep crashing](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-ios-apps-keep-crashing-try-fixes/) , and the overall performance feels sluggish.

 For the best iPhone experience, you should restart your iPhone at least once every week. If you do it every three days, that's even better. This gives the device a chance to shut down and cool off. Plus, temporary files are cleared, minor issues are fixed automatically, and you'll probably face fewer situations where you need to [force stop apps on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-force-stop-apps-on-your-phone/) .

## Force Restart When a Normal Restart Doesn't Work

 This is how you can restart any iPhone. As you saw, the process is quick and straightforward. However, if your device is frozen, the screen is black, stuck indefinitely on the Apple logo, or the touch screen isn't working, a simple restart may not work.

 In these situations, consider force restarting your iPhone. The steps to force restart are different but still easy. Doing this may help fix your iPhone and get out of any ongoing trouble.
