## Troubleshooting iPhone Silence: Expert Solutions for Restoring Audio

 There are different scenarios where you may find that your iPhone’s sound is not working. For example, maybe there’s no sound on your iPhone when you receive a call. Or maybe your iPhone speaker doesn’t play any sound even after you adjust the volume.

 Whatever’s going on, let’s look at how you can fix it when there’s no sound on your iPhone.

## 1\. Test Your iPhone’s Speaker and Your Audio Devices

 When your iPhone’s sound is not working, you should first try checking whether it’s a software or hardware problem. Here’s how:

1. Go to the**Settings** app.
2. Select**Sounds & Haptics** .
3. Under the**Ringer & Alerts** section, tap and slide the volume slider to the right. This increases the speaker volume.
4. If there is sound, your iPhone’s speaker is functional. If not, it’s likely a hardware issue that needs repairing.

![sounds and haptics on iphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sounds-haptics-iphone.jpg)

 Also, check that it’s not your audio devices, such as AirPods, causing the “no sound” problem. Test this by connecting them to other smartphones or computers. If they’re working like usual, it means that the issue is with your iPhone and you can now focus on solving it through this article. For AirPods issues, read our guide on [how to solve common AirPods problems](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apple-airpods-problems-fix/) .

## 2\. Clean Your iPhone’s Speakers

 Before moving on to troubleshooting software issues, there may simply be dust and dirt affecting speaker function, causing no sound to play on your iPhone. We have instructions you can follow to [clean your iPhone safely](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/) .

![black iphone and airpods on wooden surface](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-airpods.jpg)

 If it’s not dust and dirt, try to recall whether you accidentally dropped your iPhone in water recently. While iPhones are water-resistant, water may still get into your speakers. You can use the [Sonic](https://apps.apple.com/app/sonic/id986999895) app to eject water from the speakers if this is the case.

## 3\. Turn Off Silent Mode and Do Not Disturb

 It’s convenient to use Silent Mode and Do Not Disturb to focus at work. Therefore, a simple reason why there’s no sound on your iPhone could be that these features are still turned on.

Here’s how to turn off Silent Mode:

1. Find the**Ring/Silent** switch, located on the top-left side of your iPhone.
2. If Silent Mode is on, an orange strip shows.
3. Move the switch towards the screen to cover the orange strip. This turns off Silent Mode.

Here’s how to turn off Do Not Disturb or Focus:

1. Access your iPhone’s**Control Center** . The method to [open the Control Center](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-customize-control-center-iphone/) may vary depending on your iPhone model.
2. Tap**Do Not Disturb: On** (moon icon) to turn it off. Or tap any other Focus mode that is currently enabled to disable it.

## 4\. Check Your iPhone’s Audio Output

 There may be no sound on your iPhone because you have Bluetooth turned on and it has automatically connected to an active Bluetooth audio device, such as wireless earbuds. Therefore, your iPhone’s sound is actually playing from those instead of the speakers.

 You can disconnect the devices easily by turning off your iPhone’s Bluetooth:

1. Open the**Control Center** .
2. The**Bluetooth** button is blue when switched on. Tap to turn it off.

 Also, check that your AirPlay isn’t connected to an external speaker. In the**Control Center** :

1. Tap the**AirPlay** icon in the top-right corner.
2. Check that**iPhone** is selected.

## 5\. Check Your iPhone’s Sound Settings

 If your iPhone isn’t on Silent Mode or connected to any Bluetooth device, the problem of the sound not working may lie in your sound settings. First, adjust your volume buttons. You may think that there’s no sound on your iPhone because you accidentally turned the volume too low. To correct this, simply press the**Volume Up** button on the side of your iPhone.

 If you already have your device’s volume turned up, but still find that your iPhone sound is not working—for example, incoming texts have no alert sounds—here’s how to check your other sound settings:

1. In the**Settings** app, select**Sounds & Haptics** .
2. Scroll to the**Sounds** **and Vibration Patterns** section.
3. Tap into each tone setting to check that there’s an alert tone selected. For example, tap**Text Tone** .
4. Make sure that**None** is not selected for anything.

 If the sound issue revolves around iPhone alerts, you can refer to our detailed guide on [how to fix alert sounds on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-iphone-not-receiving-alerts/) .

## 6\. Check Third-Party App Sound Settings

 If there’s no sound on your iPhone when you’re using a specific app, you should check the sound settings within the app itself. For messaging apps like WhatsApp, check that you chose a notification sound and that**None** is not selected. For games, make sure that you didn’t mute the audio or turn off some of the music settings.

 You’ll need to root around in the relevant in-app settings to find these options as they move around for every app.

## 7\. Exit and Relaunch the Third-Party App

 If you’ve already gone through all the sound settings and they’re all switched on correctly, your iPhone’s sound not working may just be an app glitch.

 For instance, you may notice that an Instagram video has no sound, despite showing the audio icon. Even if you pressed your**Volume Up** button, the volume bar doesn’t appear either. On social media platforms like this, you can save the post, exit the app, open it again, and go to your**Saved** collection to enjoy the video.

![person holding iphone showing instagram post](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/instagram-post.jpg)

 You can also opt to view the video through another route. Instead of watching the video in your Instagram feed, tap into that Instagram profile and select the video from there instead.

## 9\. Force Restart Your iPhone

 If there’s still no sound on your iPhone, the next method you can try is to [force restart your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restart-iphone-recovery-mode/) . Don’t worry, you won’t lose any data when you force restart your iPhone.

## 10\. Restore Your iPhone to a Previous Backup

 Another potential solution is to [restore your iPhone to a previous backup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/restore-iphone-ipad-from-backup/) made when the sound was still working. However, take note that you will lose any new data that was added to your device since you made that backup. Even so, that might be worth it if it means fixing the sound on your iPhone again.

## 11\. Reset All Settings on Your iPhone

 If you tried all the suggestions above but they don’t work, the last solution is to [reset your iPhone’s settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-restore-reset-iphone-without-itunes/) . As long as you don’t select the**Erase All Content and Settings** option, rest assured that you will not lose any data. That said, you may need to erase all the content and set your iPhone up as new to fix the issue, so try that if the first option doesn’t work.

## Fix No Sound on Your iPhone Easily

 It’s common for technology to have a hiccup here and there. By following the list of solutions above, you should be able to quickly fix the problem of your iPhone’s sound not working. However, if the problem persists, it’s best to contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider for a technician to examine your device and possibly carry out a repair.
