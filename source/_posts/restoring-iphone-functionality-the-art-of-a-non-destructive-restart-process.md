## Restoring iPhone Functionality: The Art of a Non-Destructive Restart Process

 It's normal for all tech gadgets to have a hiccup now and then. Fortunately, you can often resolve the problem at home without any cost. The solution is to soft reset your device.

 Let's first quickly look at what an iPhone soft reset does. Then, we'll go through the steps on how to soft reset an iPhone, depending on the model you own.

## What Is an iPhone Soft Reset?

 A soft reset is also known as a force restart. A soft reset differs from a "normal" restart. The latter simply involves turning off your iPhone and turning it on again. You can [restart your iPhone even if the buttons are broken](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) .

 Take note that a soft reset also differs from a hard reset. When you hard reset or [factory reset your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-methods-factory-reset-iphone-without-password-ios-beta-16/) , the procedure erases your iPhone's data and restores your device to its blank, default state, as though you just bought it.

 You'll likely soft reset your iPhone when it's completely frozen. For example,[when your iPhone is stuck on the Apple logo](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-iphone-stuck-apple-logo/) . A soft reset does not erase any data.

## How to Soft Reset an iPhone 8, iPhone SE (2nd Generation), or Later

 If you own an iPhone 8, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPhone X, or other newer models, follow these steps to soft reset your iPhone:

1. Press the**Volume Up** button once and release it.
2. Press the**Volume Down** button once and release it.
3. Press and hold the**Side** button until you see the Apple logo. You can now release the**Side** button.

 It's important to press each button in immediate succession. However, you don't need to rush through the steps urgently. Pacing it at one button per second is sufficient.
