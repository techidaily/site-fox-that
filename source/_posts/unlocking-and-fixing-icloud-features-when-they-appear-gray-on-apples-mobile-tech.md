## Unlocking and Fixing iCloud Features When They Appear Gray on Apple's Mobile Tech

 When attempting to update your iCloud settings on your iPhone, you may notice some of the options to do so are grayed out, possibly including iCloud itself. This means those options are disabled.

 If that's the case, there are a few fixes you could try to re-enable them and get back into your iCloud settings.

 It's possible the only task you have to complete is agreeing to any updates to the iCloud Terms and Conditions. If this is the reason you don't have access to your iCloud settings, you should see a banner right at the top of Settings underneath your name that says**New iCloud Terms and Conditions** . Tap this, then tap**Terms and Conditions** in blue on the next screen.

 Unless you have the patience of a supreme being to read everything through, just tap**Agree** at the bottom right. Now, you should see that the Settings menu has been updated to enable iCloud and other related services.

## 2\. Check for Installed Configuration Profiles

 Sometimes, configuration profiles that you may have installed on your iPhone from work or school can restrict access to certain areas of your device. Open the Settings app, then go to**General > VPN & Device Management** .

 If you notice your installed configuration profile here, you can try removing it by tapping**Remove Downloaded Profile** or**Remove Management** . If your school or employer gave you the iPhone, it's best to check with an IT contact there first before getting rid of anything they installed.

## 3\. Check iCloud's Server Status

![Apple System Status Webpage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-system-status-webpage.jpg)

 On rare occasions, iCloud or parts of the service may be down, which could prevent access to certain features and settings. Fortunately, Apple has a handy webpage available for easily checking what services are up, down, or experiencing issues.

 There are 14 iCloud-related services listed on [Apple's System Status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) , alongside other services. This is useful to help identify a possible cause for why you can't access your iCloud settings.

 If the service is marked by a green dot, it should be online and available, which means you should continue exploring other solutions. But if you see a yellow or red dot, an issue or outage may be the culprit. It's best to wait these out until Apple fixes it.

 The System Status website also serves as a terrific way to diagnose other problems that may pop up from time to time, like [apps failing to sync through iCloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-apple-apps-sync-icloud/) .

![iOS Security Response update available on Software Update page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rapid-security-response-update-ios.jpg)

 If you're still out of luck, it may be time to update your iPhone to the latest iOS version if you're not on it already. Sometimes, your iPhone either needs a bug fix or a fresh start that comes with a new firmware release.

 The most straightforward way to update your iPhone is by going to**Settings > General > Software Update** and checking to see if a new version is available. Consider following a [detailed walkthrough for installing iOS updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/) , especially if you haven't backed up your device in a while.

 When you're ready, hit**Download and Install** if you're not on the latest release, or**Install Now** if the new version was already downloaded in the background. The installation process will take several minutes to complete, and you'll be unable to use your iPhone until it's finished.
