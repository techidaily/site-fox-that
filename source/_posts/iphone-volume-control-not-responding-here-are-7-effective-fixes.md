## IPhone Volume Control Not Responding? Here Are 7 Effective Fixes

 A broken volume button is often unexpected and can be annoying to deal with. After all, we don't realize how much we use it until it no longer works. Not being able to turn your volume down when an annoying video plays or your song is too loud can also be embarrassing.

 If your iPhone buttons aren't working properly, you should fix them as soon as possible. Luckily, there are plenty of solutions, and you can do many of them yourself.

## 1\. Make Sure Your iPhone's Volume Buttons Are Enabled

 Some might not be aware of this, but there is a setting that turns your iPhone's volume buttons on and off. This setting is already enabled by default on all devices, but it's possible someone can turn it off without realizing it.

 To check this, head to**Settings > Sounds & Haptics** and toggle on**Change with Buttons** . If this isn't enabled, this could be why your volume buttons aren't working. If it's already enabled, proceed to the next fix.

![iPhone in a leather case](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-in-a-leather-case.jpg)

 iPhones are expensive, so it's likely that most of you use a case to protect them. In some instances, your case can interfere with your volume buttons. This is especially true with cases that have layers or have built-in screen protectors.

 Simply remove your iPhone case and give your volume buttons another try. If they work now, you'll need to get a new case. After all, you probably want to keep your iPhone protected.

 It's also possible that prolonged use of a case can cause your volume buttons to get dirty. If that's the case, proceed to the next step.

## 3\. Clean Your iPhone's Volume Buttons Using Alcohol

![iPhone Ring/Silent switch](https://thmb.techidaily.com/14af88c4727edfc68754682f8d9e5a16b4632ead51b56f451896cf5d83dd52e4.jpg)

 We use our phones so much that dirt and grime can sometimes get under the buttons, especially when not using a case. So, press down on your buttons a few times to check if your buttons are stuck. You might need to clean them if they're stuck or don't seem to click down.

 To clean your volume buttons, take a cotton swab and dip it in isopropyl alcohol. The best option for cleaning electronics is 99 percent isopropyl alcohol, as it dries quickly and doesn't contain much water. It also removes dirt and grime by breaking up oils.

 Use the cotton swab to clean around your volume button the best you can. If you can push down on the buttons, doing so might help you clean it better. There's no need to overdo it with the alcohol, as it doesn't take much to work.

 After cleaning, wait a few minutes for the alcohol to dry. If your volume buttons are working now, great! If they are only working a bit better, that's a sign that they are still dirty, and you should keep cleaning them. It's worth [cleaning your entire iPhone if it's dirty](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/) .

## 4\. Reset or Restore Your iPhone

 Sometimes, firmware updates can change how the buttons on our phones work. This is especially true for older iPhone models. If you recently updated your iPhone and the volume buttons stopped working, try [restarting your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) by turning it off and on again.

 If that doesn't help, you might need to reset your device. This means backing up your iPhone and erasing all the content settings. A full reset might also work if your volume button stops working after an app download or a jailbreak attempt.

 To do this, first, you'll need to [back up your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-iphone-ipad/) . Then, go to **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Erase All Content and Settings** .

 This will wipe your phone clean and essentially make it like new. Before restoring a backup, go into the device and test the volume buttons. If they work, restore your backup.

 In some cases, restoring your backup might make them not work again. If that's the case, it might have been an app you tried to download, or your backup could be corrupted. Sadly, this means starting from scratch unless you have an older backup you can try restoring.

## 5\. Update Your iPhone

 Not updating your iPhone can also cause issues with your iPhone's volume buttons. Outdated iPhones might not work with the latest apps, and the volume controls might not work correctly as a result.

 There's also a possibility that a previous Apple update you installed is buggy, and updating again could fix the problem. To be safe, try [updating your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/) to see if it resolves the issue.

 You can update it by heading to**Settings > General > Software Update** . Here, you can see if a new iOS version is available. If you're using a beta version of iOS, it might be time to switch back to the stable public build and report this issue to Apple.

## 6\. Control Your iPhone's Volume Without Using Volume Buttons

![iphone screen volume control](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iphone-screen-volume-control.jpg)

 If you use apps like Spotify, you can control the volume within the app without a physical button. If all else fails, there are still ways to control your volume without using the buttons. The easiest way is to use the Control Center.

 You can open the Control Center and adjust your volume by swiping down from the top-right corner of your iPhone. If your iPhone has a Home button, you'll need to swipe up from the bottom of the screen instead.

![iphone control panel volume control](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iphone-control-panel-volume-control-1.jpg)

 If you have AirPods, you can say, "Hey Siri, turn up the volume." Other Bluetooth headphones typically have built-in volume controls, which you can use as well. This means that you won't have to keep going to your phone when you want to change the volume.

### Control the Volume With AssistiveTouch

 If you're looking for another way to control the volume, consider using AssistiveTouch. You can set the AssistiveTouch button to open a menu to control your volume on the screen or have it either turn up or down when tapped.

 To use it, go to**Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch** . Here, you can set your device to turn the volume down with one tap and turn it up with two taps.

## 7\. Get Your Volume Buttons Repaired

 If cleaning your buttons and resetting your iPhone doesn't fix the volume buttons, you most likely need to get the buttons repaired. This is especially true if you recently damaged your iPhone or exposed it to water.

 If your iPhone is under warranty,[make an Apple Store appointment at a Genius Bar](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-store-appointment-genius-bar/) , and your repair will most likely be free. Otherwise, you will need to pay for a repair out of pocket.

 So, next time you upgrade your iPhone, consider learning more about [the AppleCare+ extended warranty](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/applecare-what-are-your-options-is-it-really-worth-it/) and see if it's worth it so you won't get caught with a costly repair again.

 While repairing your iPhone's volume buttons out of pocket can be expensive, it's cheaper than buying a new phone. But if you don't want to pay this price, maybe it's [time to upgrade your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/7-signs-its-time-to-upgrade-your-iphone/) .

## Will Apple Discontinue the Volume Button?

 Considering Apple has discontinued the Home button, headphone jack, and Ring/Silent switch, it's logical to assume that one day the volume buttons might disappear too. For now, the volume buttons remain—even the iPhone 15 models have volume buttons.

 While they don't break often, it's bothersome if they do. Luckily, the solutions mentioned above will fix your iPhone volume buttons in most cases, and you'll be able to change your volume again in no time.
