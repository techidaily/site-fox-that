## Apple Won't Accept My Credit/Debit? Here Are 6 Fixes

 Picture this: You're going about your day when you receive an email from Apple saying it declined the payment option attached to your subscription service. You're prompted to update your payment method to continue enjoying the service, but you weren't aware your card needed updating.

 Or perhaps you want to add a payment method to your Apple ID, but it gets declined. What do you do in either situation? Below, we'll list a few steps you can take when Apple declines your payment method.

## 1\. Check Your Payment Information

 When Apple declines your payment method, the first thing to try is to check your payment information to ensure it's accurate and up-to-date. If your billing details, such as your address or ZIP code, is incorrect, this can cause your payment method to be declined.

 If your current payment method has expired, you must renew your credit card and update your payment information or add a new payment method.

To check your payment information on an iPhone or iPad:

1. Go to**Settings** , then tap your**Apple ID name** at the top.
2. Tap on**Payment & Shipping** , then under**Payment Methods** , select your credit card.
3. Check your card number, expiry date, CVV, and billing information. If you notice any discrepancies, update them.
4. Tap**Done** in the top-right corner.

 There you go. You've successfully checked and updated your payment information.

## 2\. Try a Different Payment Method

 If Apple still declines your payment method, try a different payment method. You can add a new card to your Apple ID and see if it works.

 Besides cards, you can try alternative payment methods like [your Apple Account balance](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-funds-to-apple-account-balance/) ,[an Apple Gift Card](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-gift-card-vs-app-store-gift-card-vs-apple-store-gift-card/) , a debit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay, depending on whether or not they're valid in your country or region.

 Check [Apple's Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202631) to see what payment methods you can use with your Apple ID.
