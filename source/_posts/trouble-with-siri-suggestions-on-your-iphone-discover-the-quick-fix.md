## Trouble with Siri Suggestions on Your iPhone? Discover the Quick Fix

 If you own an iPhone, Siri is your best friend. It can schedule emails, set reminders, send text messages, initiate phone calls, and even give suggestions based on your iPhone usage.

 Depending on Siri is unavoidable if you use it for these tasks. But what happens if Siri suggestions stop popping up on your iPhone? No worries, because we have a few fixes you can try.

## Restart Your iPhone

 If your Siri suggestions are still not popping up, you can restart your iPhone to troubleshoot it. However, your iPhone doesn't have a restart option, so you'll have to power off your iPhone and turn it back on.

 The buttons you need to press to do this may vary depending on the model, but it's easy to [restart any iPhone, even if the buttons are broken](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) .

## Get the Best of Siri Suggestions

 Siri suggestions make it easy to start a search the moment you swipe down on your Home Screen. In fact, you wouldn't need to type anything in Spotlight search to launch your favorite app, as Siri would've already suggested it for you.

 However, if none of these solutions worked in your favor, you can contact Apple Support or visit a nearby Apple Store for in-person assistance.
