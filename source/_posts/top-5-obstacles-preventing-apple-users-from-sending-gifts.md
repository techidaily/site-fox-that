## Top 5 Obstacles Preventing Apple Users From Sending Gifts

 Did you know you can send gifts from your Apple device? You can send books, movies, music, videos, and apps from your Apple apps to a friend if they use Apple's media services like Apple Music or the App Store.

 However, sometimes you might be unable to send gifts from your device. So, if you're experiencing such an issue, here are some possible reasons.

## 1\. The Recipient Lives in a Different Country or Region

 Similar to how the recipient of an [Apple Gift Card](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-gift-card-vs-app-store-gift-card-vs-apple-store-gift-card/) can't use it outside the country where it was purchased, the recipient of a gift from an Apple device can't use it outside of the country or region where it was sent because their Apple ID is in a different country or region.

 For instance, if you're going to gift an app or game from the App Store in the United States, the person you're sending it to must also have an Apple ID in the United States. However, they can work around this by [changing their App Store country](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dont-switch-international-itunes-media-app-store-youve-read/) , but it has its own set of drawbacks.

## 2\. You're in an Unsupported Country or Region

 You might be unable to send gifts because you can't buy music, apps, movies, or books in your country or region. This is because certain countries or regions cannot access some Apple services. For instance, if you live in Croatia, you won't be able to gift books from the App Store.

 It's possible to solve this problem by changing your App Store and iTunes country, but, as we mentioned earlier, it has a few issues of its own. You can visit [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411) to learn what Apple services your country can access.

## 3\. Your Family Sharing Settings

[Apple's Family Sharing](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/set-family-sharing-share-apps-music-itunes-purchases/) lets you share Apple content and subscriptions with your family. If you've enabled this feature on your device and turned on**Ask to Buy** , it'll prevent you from sending gifts. After turning it off, you should be able to purchase gifts.

## 4\. Using the Wrong Device to Gift an Item

 What you can gift depends on whether you're on an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC. You can send gifts from the App Store, Apple Books, or iTunes Store on an iPhone or iPad. On a Mac or PC, you can send gifts using the iTunes Store.

 You need an iPhone or iPad to gift apps, TV shows, or movies and a Mac or PC to gift individual songs. For now, there's no workaround for this.

## 5\. You're Trying to Gift a Free App

 If you can't gift an item from the App Store, it might be because it's free. While you can only gift paid items, it is possible to share free ones as well. To do so, tap the share button beside the app, then select a recipient or your means of sending it.

## Make the Most of Apple's Gifting Feature

 Looking for a great gift for a loved one who's also an Apple user? Send them an app, song, book, or another item you know they'll love from your device.

 And if you want them to have flexibility in choosing apps or books, send them an Apple Gift Card instead. Whatever it is, they're bound to appreciate the gift.
