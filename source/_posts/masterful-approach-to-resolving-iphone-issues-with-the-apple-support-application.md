## Masterful Approach to Resolving iPhone Issues with the Apple Support Application

 Smartphones like iPhones are designed to be an all-in-one device for your needs, even if those needs relate to the iPhone itself. So if you need help with your iPhone, you don’t need to go searching the internet for a solution, just open the Apple Support app instead.

 Discover what the Apple Support app is below and how it can help you with your iPhone woes.

## What Is the Apple Support App?

 Apple Support is a dedicated app that provides all the support you might need for your Apple devices. It comes built-in on iPhones and iPads. However, unlike Messages and Safari, you can delete this pre-installed app. If you removed yours, you can easily download it again for free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-support/id1130498044) .

 For you to be able to use the app, you need to be running iOS 14 or later.

 The app lists all the devices registered to your Apple account and keeps a record of your model, warranty, and OS for each of them. This can be beneficial for people who need to [check their iOS version](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-check-iphone-ios-version/) .

 The devices you own are listed at the top, under**My Devices** .
