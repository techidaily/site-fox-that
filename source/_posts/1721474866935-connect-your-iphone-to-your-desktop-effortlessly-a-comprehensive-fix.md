 If your iPhone's not connecting to your computer, you're not alone. Many people face this frustrating issue. Luckily, there are easy fixes when your iPhone doesn't connect to a PC or Mac. It can be something as simple as a busted cable, a driver issue, or a buggy instance of iTunes.

 Whether iTunes or your computer won't recognize your iPhone or iPad, or you're getting the "0xE" or "unknown" error, our troubleshooting tips right ahead will help you resolve the issue.

## 1\. Trust This Computer When Prompted

 Connecting your iPhone to a computer for the first time produces a "Trust This Computer" security prompt. To authorize this action, choose**Trust** on the iPhone.

!["Trust This Computer" prompt on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-ios-17-trust-this-computer-prompt-iphone.jpg)

![Entering iPhone passcode to authorize "Trust This Computer" prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-ios-17-trust-this-computer-enter-passcode-prompt-iphone.jpg)

Close

 Doing so will allow iOS to permit the trusted computer to sync and access data on your iPhone. If you missed the prompt, unplug your iPhone and plug it back again.

## 2\. Check the Lightning Cable

 A broken or frayed Lightning cable can lead to connection issues and result in the iPhone refusing to connect to the computer. Confirm that the iPhone charges when plugged into your computer or a different source, like a wall outlet. If it doesn't, it's definitely the cable's fault.

![Lightning to USB-C cable for iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iphone-lightning-usb-c-cable.jpg)

 In that case, try switching to a new cable, like an [MFi-certified Lightning cable](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-lightning-cables-charge-iphone-ipad/) , or borrow a cable from your friend to see if yours is bad.

## 3\. Check the Lightning Port for Dirt

 Dust and lint accumulating inside the iPhone's charging port over time can block electrical signals. Use a toothpick or the SIM ejector tool that came with your iPhone to remove any dirt from the Lightning port, which should fix the "This Accessory May Not Be Supported" error.

![iPhone XS Max in hand, with a SIM Card Eject tool inserted in the Lightning port](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apple-iphone-xs-max-lightning-port-sim-card-eject-tool.JPG)

## 4\. Try a Different USB Port

 If it's not the cable, it might be the port. Try connecting your iPhone using a different USB-A or USB-C port with a cable you know works to see if your computer has a faulty port.

 If that doesn't help, uninstall everything related to iTunes, iCloud, and Bonjour in**Settings > Apps > Installed Apps** , then redownload iTunes from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/itunes/9pb2mz1zmb1s) or [Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) .

## 7\. Update Your Computer

 Installing all available updates in**Start > Settings > Windows Update** may squish bugs that could be preventing your iPhone from connecting to your PC.

![Updating the system Windows software on a PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-update-windows.png)

 To [update your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-mac-software/) , click**System Settings** (macOS Ventura and later) or**System Preferences** (macOS Monterey and older) in the Apple menu, then choose**General > Software Update** .

## 8\. Fix Driver Issues on Windows

 Drivers are software components responsible for how external devices communicate with Windows. A damaged or outdated driver might prevent iTunes from recognizing your iPhone. You can fix this problem by reinstalling Apple's Mobile Device USB driver.

### If You Downloaded iTunes From Apple's Website

 Downloading iTunes from Apple's website also gets you Apple's updater which runs at startup. It doesn't ship with the Microsoft Store version of iTunes because the store automatically updates all apps downloaded through it. If you downloaded iTunes from Apple, follow these steps to reinstall the Apple Mobile Device USB driver:

1. Disconnect your iPhone from the computer.
2. Unlock your iPhone, go to the Home Screen, and plug the device into the computer. If iTunes launches automatically, quit the app.
3. Open a new window in**File Explorer** .
4. Enter the following location in the address bar at the top of File Explorer, then hit**Enter** :  
%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers
5. Right-click on the**usbaapl64.inf** or**usbaapl.inf** file, and choose**Install** .  
![The Install option in Windows driver settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Windows-10-Apple-Driver-Install-Files.png)
6. Disconnect your iPhone and restart your computer. Then, reconnect it and open iTunes.

### If You Downloaded iTunes From the Microsoft Store

 On Windows 10 and later, you can install iTunes via the Microsoft Store which makes updates much simpler. If you have the Microsoft Store version of iTunes, follow the instructions below to reinstall the Apple Mobile Device USB driver:

1. Disconnect your iPhone, unlock it, and reconnect it to the PC, but quit iTunes if it opens.
2. Right-click the**Start** button and choose**Device Manager** .
3. Find and expand the**Portable Devices** section.
4. Right-click on your iPhone, choose**Update driver** , and select**Search automatically for updated driver software** .

### How to Troubleshoot the Apple Mobile Device USB Driver

 If your iPhone doesn't connect to your computer even after following the steps above, you'll need to troubleshoot the Apple Mobile Device USB driver further with these steps:

1. Right-click on the**Start** button and choose**Device Manager** .
2. Find the**Universal Serial Bus controllers** section and look for the**Apple Mobile Device USB Driver** . If you don't see the driver, try connecting your iPhone with a different cable or use a different PC to sync your iPhone.  
![The Apple Mobile Device USB Driver in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Windows-10-Device-Manager-Find-Apple-Driver.png)
3. If you see the driver, check if third-party security apps are blocking your iPhone from connecting. Disable any antivirus tools and attempt the connection again. After doing this, it's worth reinstalling the**usbaapl64.inf** or**usbaapl.inf** file again (as discussed above).

Close

[Resetting your iPhone's network settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-iphone/) won't remove apps and data but may fix connection problems between the iPhone and the computer. Go to **Settings > General > Transfer & Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings** and enter your passcode to confirm.

 Resetting network settings will forget Wi-Fi networks and restore VPN settings, device name, and trust settings to the factory default values.

## 10\. Reset Your Devices

 If nothing above has worked, the last step is to reset your devices. To [factory reset your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-restore-reset-iphone-without-itunes/) , go to **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Erase All Content and Settings** .

![7-erase-iphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-erase-iphone.PNG)

Close

 You'll need to enter your device passcode or your Apple ID password to confirm and start the restoration process.

 Resetting your iPhone will wipe all settings, apps, media, and data on the device. So, make an iCloud backup before proceeding to avoid losing any data permanently.

 Similarly, you can [factory reset your Windows PC](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) by venturing into**Settings > System > Recovery > Reset this PC** . Again, make sure to [create a complete backup in Windows](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-complete-backup/) before doing this because doing so will erase all the data on your machine.

 If you use a Mac instead, you can [erase all content and settings in macOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-erase-all-content-and-settings-on-mac/) with a few clicks.

## 11\. Try a Different Computer

 If all else fails, connect your iPhone to a different computer to see if that makes a difference. In rare cases, your iPhone won't sync with certain Windows configurations, and nothing you do will fix it. Trying a different computer is the easiest way to confirm this.

## 12\. Use an iTunes Alternative

![The iMazing app on the Mac](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8-imazing.png)

 If iTunes or Finder continues to fail to recognize your iPhone, consider a third-party solution. An app like iMazing offers features like two-way sync, one-click backups from any device, selective syncing of individual items such as photos and music, and more.

**Download:** [iMazing](http://imazing.com/) (Free, premium version available)

## 13\. Contact Apple Support

 If the issue persists, you'll need to contact Apple Support. Use the [Apple Support site](https://getsupport.apple.com/) to talk to a customer care representative and ask for help. They will be able to assist in ways we couldn't, especially if your iPhone's hardware is at fault.

## Use Your iPhone and Mac Together

 As you can see, there are so many possible reasons why you're unable to connect your iPhone to your computer. But hopefully, the solutions above fixed your issue, and you're back to using your iPhone with your Mac or PC. If not, it's best to get it looked at by an Apple Genius at the nearest Apple Store.
