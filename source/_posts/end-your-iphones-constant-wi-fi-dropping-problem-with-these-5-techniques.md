## End Your iPhone's Constant Wi-Fi Dropping Problem with These 5 Techniques

 You rebooted your iPhone, turned off Airplane Mode, and restarted your router, yet you still have spotty Wi-Fi. Should you bring your iPhone in for repairs? Not yet.

 Consider going through a few more troubleshooting tips. Here are some quick, simple fixes for iPhones that keep connecting and disconnecting from Wi-Fi networks.

## 1\. Forget the Malfunctioning Network

 Before doing anything complex, try removing the malfunctioning network from your iPhone. Otherwise, it'll keep joining the Wi-Fi connection. This fix will likely work if you recently changed your Wi-Fi password, your internet has been spotty, or you set up a new router.

So, follow the simple instructions below:

1. Launch**Settings** and go to**Wi-Fi** .
2. Find the malfunctioning network, then tap the**(i)** button on the right side of its name. It will open the Information page.
3. Hit**Forget This Network** , then confirm the action by tapping**Forget** in the dialogue box.
4. Go back to the**Wi-Fi** menu and rejoin the network manually. Double-check your password—someone might have changed it without you knowing.

## 2\. Check Your iPhone's VPN Settings

 There are several [free VPNs for iPhones and iPads](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-vpn-iphone-ipad/) . They'll help you bypass geo-restrictions, access confidential information, or use insecure networks safely.

 Just don't leave them running. VPN apps occasionally cause internet connectivity problems, especially when switching between networks. Disable them if you're using your home Wi-Fi.

 You can turn off your VPN within the respective apps. But if your VPN merges with your iPhone's built-in VPN client, follow these steps in the Settings app:

1. Go to**Settings** \>**General** .
2. Scroll down to**VPN & Device Management** —you'll find it near the bottom of the page.
3. Tap**VPN** and remove any active VPN configurations.

## 3\. Turn Off the Wi-Fi Assist Feature

Close

 The iPhone's Wi-Fi Assist feature switches to cellular data whenever Wi-Fi gets spotty. Let's say a page has been loading for over 30 seconds. Instead of stubbornly running the same network, your iPhone automatically uses your cellular data.

 Although helpful, this feature is expensive. The device will keep dropping your network until it improves—you can't switch to Wi-Fi manually.

 We suggest turning off Wi-Fi Assist by default. Just use your data as needed. Otherwise, you'll drain your cellular data plan if you're often stuck with weak Wi-Fi.

1. Go to**Settings** \>**Cellular** .
2. Scroll down to the**Wi-Fi Assist** option at the bottom of the page.
3. Toggle off the switch. Turn on your cellular data first if Wi-Fi Assist is grayed out.

## 4\. Reset Your Network Settings

 If your iPhone still disconnects from Wi-Fi after resetting the network settings, check your iOS version. Update to the latest iOS firmware available. Apple might have fixed the glitch that's making your device intermittently drop Wi-Fi connections. Here's what you need to do:

1. Go to**Settings** \>**General** \>**Software Update** .
2. Check if an update is available.

 Alternatively, if you've been facing connectivity issues after updating, you have the option to [downgrade iOS to the previous version](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-downgrade-ios/) . Although the process requires technical know-how, it should only take a few minutes.

## Keep Your iPhone Connected to Wi-Fi

 Try all the above tips if your iPhone keeps dropping the Wi-Fi connection. You should regain internet access shortly. Connectivity problems often stem from minor bugs—they rarely indicate serious hardware or software issues, so don't panic.

 But if none of your devices can connect to Wi-Fi, check the internet connection. Your router or ISP might be to blame. Follow standard troubleshooting steps, like switching to a wired connection, checking your network card, and restarting your router.
