## Troubleshooting WhatsApp: Solutions When Your Chat History Isn't Syncing with iCloud

 WhatsApp, like most other instant messaging platforms, offers a great backup feature that lets you safeguard your personal chats and media to the cloud. You can then easily access and download this data when you need to use WhatsApp on a new phone.

 But sometimes this backup feature stops working on iPhones because of issues like improper iCloud settings. Luckily, you can easily get your WhatsApp backups up and running. Here are some easy fixes to try when WhatsApp isn't backing up to iCloud:

## 1\. Check if WhatsApp Is Enabled for iCloud Backup

 To ensure a seamless WhatsApp backup, make sure you have WhatsApp enabled on your iPhone as an app that can use iCloud. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Launch**iPhone Settings** , tap on your**name** on the top, and go to**iCloud** .
2. In the Section,**Apps Using iCloud** , and select**Show All** .
3. Scroll down and**toggle** **on** the switch right next to**WhatsApp** . If it is already on, consider switching it off and then on again.

## 2\. Make Sure You Have Free Space Available

 For iCloud backups to work correctly, your cloud must have at least twice the storage space as the actual size of the backup. So, if your WhatsApp isn't backing up to iCloud, consider checking the size of the backup and comparing it to the space available on your cloud.

1. Launch**WhatsApp** and go to**Settings > Chats** .
2. Select**Chat Backup** from the options.
3. You will be able to see the backup**size** below the details of your last WhatsApp backup.

To check your available iCloud storage space:

1. Go to**iCloud** in your**iPhone Settings** .
2. The information regarding the used and**available iCloud space** will be available at the top.
3. If the backup size is larger than the space available on your iCloud, go to**Manage Account Storage** . Here you can review any large files and delete them. You can even [upgrade your iCloud storage](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-upgrade-icloud-storage/) if additional space is required.

 Sometimes, the issue of failed WhatsApp backups can be resolved by manually backing up your chats through the app.

Here's how you can do that:

1. Go to**Chat Backup** on WhatsApp.
2. To manually start the backup process, tap**Back Up Now** .

 While not necessary, consider keeping WhatsApp open during this manual backup. This means not swiping the WhatsApp page up in the app switcher. You may use other apps or put your iPhone to sleep during this time though.

## 4\. Check the iCloud Server Status

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Sometimes, the issue may not be with your device or with WhatsApp, but rather with iCloud services. Visit the [Apple System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) page to see whether iCloud servers are down or having server issues.

 If the circle beside**iCloud Backup** isn't green, consider backing up WhatsApp once it is working again.

## 5\. Restart Your iPhone

 Restarting your iPhone will fix a number of software-related issues, including those involving iCloud backups.

To restart your device:

1. Hold down the power button, or the power button and the volume up button on newer models, until the slider appears.
2. Slide the slider to turn off your iPhone.
3. After a little while, press and hold the power button to switch your iPhone back on.
4. Check to see if the WhatsApp backup succeeds now.

## 6\. Update Your iPhone and WhatsApp

Outdated software can also cause backup issues.

To update your iPhone, follow these steps:

1. Launch**Settings** and go to**General > Software Update** .
2. If an update is available download it by entering your**passcode** .
3. Once done, select**Install Now** and accept the terms and conditions to initiate the installation process.

 WhatsApp also routinely updates its application to resolve bug fixes and system glitches. That's [why you should never disable automatic updates on your phone](https://www.makeuseof.com/never-disable-auto-app-updates-android-iphone/) if you're looking to use the best version of WhatsApp. To update the app, head on over to the**App Store,** search WhatsApp, and check if an update is available.

## 7\. Remove Videos From Your iCloud Backup

 Large videos in particular can end up using a lot of iCloud storage space. So, if your iCloud backup keeps failing, consider removing these videos from iCloud backup.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to**Chat Backup** and**Toggle off** the switch right beside**Include Videos** .
2. Then, tap**Back Up Now** and see if the process succeeds.

 You can always turn this switch back on to re-include WhatsApp videos in your iCloud backup.

## 8\. Delete the Existing iCloud Backup

 If none of the above fixes work, it's likely your WhatsApp backup contains something broken. You can fix this by deleting your current iCloud backup:

1. Go to**iPhone Settings >** **Apple ID >** **iCloud >** **Manage Account Storage** .
2. Tap**WhatsApp Messenger** .
3. Tap**Delete Data from iCloud**
4. Once the backup has been deleted, return to WhatsApp and start a fresh backup.

## Seamless WhatsApp Backups Can Give You Peace of Mind

 It might be frustrating when WhatsApp keeps failing at successfully backing up your chats to iCloud. But there are some easy fixes that you can try to remedy this. Start with the basics, like double-checking your settings and making sure you have enough iCloud storage.

 If these simple things don't work, go on to more complex remedies like upgrading your iOS and deleting old backups. But in the off-chance that none of these solutions work, you should contact Apple Support or WhatsApp Support for tailored help.
