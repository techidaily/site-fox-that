## Where Do FaceTime Live Photos Go?

 It's all well and good snapping a photo while you're using FaceTime, but you need to know where those photos go to enjoy them after the call. The answer is pretty simple: FaceTime photos save directly to the Photos app on your device.

 To view your FaceTime photos, open the**Photos** app and go to the**Library** tab at the bottom, then select the**All Photos** view to make sure your device doesn't filter them out. Scroll to the date and time you took a photo to find it.

![Library tab in the Photos app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/03-library-tab-photos-app-ios.jpg)

 You can simplify matters by viewing only your Live Photos. To do this, go to the**Albums** tab and look for the**Live Photos** album. Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac creates this album automatically as soon as you add a Live Photo to your library.

### Create a Smart Album for All Your FaceTime Live Photos

 If you want to keep all your FaceTime Live Photos in the same place, create a Smart Album to automatically capture them all. You need to [use a Mac to create a Smart Album in the Photos app](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-and-use-smart-albums-on-mac/) . Unfortunately, you can't create Smart Albums from the Photos app on an iPhone or iPad.

 Click the**plus (+)** button that appears when you hover over**My Albums** in the sidebar and choose**Smart Album** from the popup. Name your Smart Album, then configure the following filter using the dropdown menus:**Lens includes FaceTime** .

![Creating a smart album in Photos on Mac](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/create-smart-albums-photos-mac.jpg)

 You'll need to type "FaceTime" into the third box manually since it isn't an option in the dropdown menu.

 Click**OK** to create your Smart Album. Photos should fill the album with all the Live Photos you've captured during FaceTime calls. Any new FaceTime photos you take should also appear in the album automatically.

 If you [sync Photos over iCloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-sync-icloud-photos/) , this Smart Album will become available from the**Albums** tab on your other devices as well.

## How to Take Photos During FaceTime Calls

 You can take a Live Photo during a FaceTime call using the**shutter** button. This appears when you tap the screen on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch or when you hover your mouse over the FaceTime window on a Mac. It looks like two white circles, one inside the other.

 If you're in a FaceTime group call on your iPhone, select the person's tile you want to take a photo of, then tap the**Fullscreen** button to reveal the**shutter** button. However, if you're on a Mac during a group call, double-click the person you want to photograph, then click the**shutter** button.

 A Live Photo is better than taking a screenshot because it doesn't capture the FaceTime user interface. It also saves a couple of seconds of video and audio from right before and after you take the photo. In the future, you can even [turn your Live Photos into videos](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-live-photos-into-videos-on-iphone-mac/) .

### How to Take a FaceTime Photo Without Telling the Other Person

 When you take a photo of someone using FaceTime, it sends a notification to their device to let them know that you took a picture. There's no way to avoid sending this notification when you take a photo, but you can get around it by taking a screenshot instead.

 To do so, press**Volume Up** along with the**Side** button on your iPhone or iPad (or press the**Home** button with the**Side** button if your device has a Home button). On a Mac, press**Cmd + Shift + 5** , then click on the FaceTime window.

 Alternatively, hit**Cmd + Shift + 3** to take a screenshot of your entire screen. Aside from these two options, there are other [ways to take screenshots on your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-a-mac/) .

## How to Enable Live Photos in Your FaceTime Settings

 Before you can take a Live Photo in FaceTime, both you and the person you're taking a photo of need to enable Live Photos in your FaceTime Settings. So, if you don't want other people to take photos of you during FaceTime calls, you should disable this option. Keep in mind that other people will still be able to take a screenshot, though.

 On an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to**Settings > FaceTime** . Scroll down and turn on**FaceTime Live Photos** .

![iOS Settings menu FaceTime selected](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ios-settings-menu-facetime-selected.jpg)

![FaceTime Live Photos toggle enabled](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/facetime-live-photos-toggle-enabled.jpg)

Close

 On a Mac, open**FaceTime** and go to**FaceTime > Settings** from the menu bar. In the**Settings** tab, turn on the option to**Allow Live Photos to be captured during video calls** .

## Troubleshooting FaceTime Photo Problems

 There are lots of problems that might stop you from being able to snap a Live Photo during your FaceTime calls. If you can't find the shutter button, FaceTime isn't saving your photos, or you have trouble finding FaceTime photos after you take them, try these troubleshooting tips to fix it.

### 1\. Enable FaceTime Live Photos on Both Devices

 To take a photo of someone during a FaceTime call, everyone on the call needs to turn on FaceTime Live Photos from their device settings. Go to**Settings > FaceTime** to do this. Make sure the person you're taking a photo of checks their settings as well.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Open the Photos App on Your Device

 When you take Live Photos in FaceTime, it automatically saves those pictures to the Photos app on your device. If you haven't used Photos before, open it on your device to initialize the app before FaceTime can save photos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Update to the Latest Operating System

 In some older versions of iOS, Apple temporarily removed the ability to take Live Photos on FaceTime. This was presumably due to a FaceTime security bug. FaceTime photos are available now, but you need to update your device to the latest software to use them. The person you're taking a photo of needs to update their device to the latest software as well.

 On an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to**Settings > General > Software Update** . On a Mac, go to**System Settings > General > Software Update** .

![Software update available in macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/software-update-macos-settings.jpg)

 Install any updates that are available there by clicking**Update Now** .

### 4\. Restart Your Device

 No matter what [FaceTime problem you're encountering](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facetime-not-working/) , you should always try to fix it by restarting your device. This is a remarkably effective troubleshooting step that only takes a moment to try out. Power off your iPhone, iPad, or Mac as you usually would, then wait 30 seconds before restarting it again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Restart FaceTime on Your Device

 Finally, try turning FaceTime off and on in your device settings. You may need to sign in to your Apple ID account again when you do this.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > FaceTime** and toggle the**FaceTime** button at the top of the screen.

![iOS Settings menu FaceTime selected](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ios-settings-menu-facetime-selected.jpg)

![FaceTime enabled in iOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/facetime-enabled-ios-1.jpg)

Close

 On a Mac, open the**FaceTime** app and go to**FaceTime > Settings** from the menu bar. In the**Settings** tab, uncheck the box for**Enable this account** , then check the box again to re-enable FaceTime.

## Revisit Your FaceTime Photos on iPhone, iPad and Mac

 All the FaceTime Live Photos you take during a call are permanently stored on your device. Whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, FaceTime Live Photos are automatically saved in the Photos app.

 If you have iCloud Photos enabled, you'll be able to view these photos on all your devices—even your Windows PC. In case you face any problems, for instance, FaceTime photos not saving, make sure you go through the troubleshooting steps above.
