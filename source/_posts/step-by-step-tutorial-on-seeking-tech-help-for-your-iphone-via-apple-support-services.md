## Step-by-Step Tutorial on Seeking Tech Help for Your iPhone via Apple Support Services

 Smartphones like iPhones are designed to be an all-in-one device for your needs, even if those needs relate to the iPhone itself. So if you need help with your iPhone, you don’t need to go searching the internet for a solution, just open the Apple Support app instead.

 Discover what the Apple Support app is below and how it can help you with your iPhone woes.

## What Is the Apple Support App?

 Apple Support is a dedicated app that provides all the support you might need for your Apple devices. It comes built-in on iPhones and iPads. However, unlike Messages and Safari, you can delete this pre-installed app. If you removed yours, you can easily download it again for free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-support/id1130498044) .

 For you to be able to use the app, you need to be running iOS 14 or later.

 The app lists all the devices registered to your Apple account and keeps a record of your model, warranty, and OS for each of them. This can be beneficial for people who need to [check their iOS version](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-check-iphone-ios-version/) .

 The devices you own are listed at the top, under**My Devices** .

## How to Get Help With the Apple Support App

 You can use the Apple Support to help you with concerns like resetting your Apple ID password, fixing Bluetooth issues, or troubleshooting connectivity concerns. Open the**Apple Support** app, tap on your**iPhone** , and select from the listed topics.

 If you find it difficult to find a helpful article for your concern, the app allows you to explain your problems in your own words. Just tap**Describe Your Issue** , then type your concern. It will list related articles based on keywords from your description.

 If you still can’t find the article you need to help resolve your issue, you can chat or call an Apple technician. Most topics give you the option to contact Support. You should see a**Message** or**Call** option under**Contact** .

![Contact Option in Apple Support App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Contact-Option-in-Apple-Support-App.PNG)

 When you tap Call, you’ll be asked to select a schedule by which an Apple technician will contact you. If you choose Message, you’ll be redirected to Messages, where you can instantly chat with an Apple technician.

2. You might be asked to select your carrier from the available options.
3. Tap**Allow Location Access** to turn on Location Services for the app so that it can find your location and suggest nearby service providers. Alternatively, you can type a location in the search bar.
