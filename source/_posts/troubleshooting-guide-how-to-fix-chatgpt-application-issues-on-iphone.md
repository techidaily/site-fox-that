## 1\. Verify Your iPhone's Internet Connection

 It is essential for your iPhone to have a stable Wi-Fi or cellular connection for the ChatGPT app to work. If you do not have one, your prompts will not be received or replied to.

 If you're unsure whether your internet connection is causing problems, open the app and check. A banner saying "There is a problem with your internet connection" will appear on the top of your screen. You can also try running some other internet-based apps or some links in Safari.

Close

 If you do have a strong internet connection, but it doesn't seem to be working on your device, you can try reconnecting to the network by entering the Wi-Fi password again or disabling and re-enabling cellular data from the Control Center.

## 2\. Ensure All Permissions Are Enabled

 The ChatGPT app requires your permission to run certain features on your iPhone for optimum performance. For example, if the voice input feature isn't working, it may be because you haven't allowed microphone access for the app. To make sure all permissions are enabled, follow these steps:

1. Open**Settings** .
2. Scroll down until you find**ChatGPT** from the list of apps and tap to open.
3. Turn on the toggle for**Microphone** ,**Mobile Data** , and all the toggles under**Siri & Search** .

## 3\. Ensure Sufficient iPhone Storage Space

 When your iPhone's storage is maxed out,[your iPhone tends to lag and slow down](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-slow-iphone/) . This interferes with apps and features on your device, including the ChatGPT app. To restore optimal functionality, take some time to declutter your digital space.

 Delete unnecessary apps, clear your cache, or offload some photos to iCloud. Everything on your iPhone that is not useful and can be cast aside, it will be best to do so. You can get started by going to**Settings > General > iPhone Storage** .

## 4\. Disconnect VPN

 VPNs are great tools for online privacy, but they can potentially interfere with connections to the server. Many apps have a hard time maintaining a stable connection or syncing data with VPNs, especially if the service is having a slow day, and ChatGPT can be one of them.

 Users have reported that a VPN connection stopped their app from working, and disconnecting immediately caused the problem to cease. You can always turn your VPN connection back on after you're done using the app, as disconnecting and connecting is as easy as a single tap from the Settings menu or third-party VPN app.
