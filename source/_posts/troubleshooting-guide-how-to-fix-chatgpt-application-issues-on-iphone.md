## 1\. Verify Your iPhone's Internet Connection

 It is essential for your iPhone to have a stable Wi-Fi or cellular connection for the ChatGPT app to work. If you do not have one, your prompts will not be received or replied to.

 If you're unsure whether your internet connection is causing problems, open the app and check. A banner saying "There is a problem with your internet connection" will appear on the top of your screen. You can also try running some other internet-based apps or some links in Safari.

 If you do have a strong internet connection, but it doesn't seem to be working on your device, you can try reconnecting to the network by entering the Wi-Fi password again or disabling and re-enabling cellular data from the Control Center.

## 2\. Ensure All Permissions Are Enabled

 The ChatGPT app requires your permission to run certain features on your iPhone for optimum performance. For example, if the voice input feature isn't working, it may be because you haven't allowed microphone access for the app. To make sure all permissions are enabled, follow these steps:

1. Open**Settings** .
2. Scroll down until you find**ChatGPT** from the list of apps and tap to open.
3. Turn on the toggle for**Microphone** ,**Mobile Data** , and all the toggles under**Siri & Search** .

## 3\. Ensure Sufficient iPhone Storage Space

 When your iPhone's storage is maxed out,[your iPhone tends to lag and slow down](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-slow-iphone/) . This interferes with apps and features on your device, including the ChatGPT app. To restore optimal functionality, take some time to declutter your digital space.

 Delete unnecessary apps, clear your cache, or offload some photos to iCloud. Everything on your iPhone that is not useful and can be cast aside, it will be best to do so. You can get started by going to**Settings > General > iPhone Storage** .

 If you're unsure how to do this, you can learn [how to create free space on iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-storage-full-create-free-space-ios/) if your iPhone's storage is full.

## 4\. Disconnect VPN

 VPNs are great tools for online privacy, but they can potentially interfere with connections to the server. Many apps have a hard time maintaining a stable connection or syncing data with VPNs, especially if the service is having a slow day, and ChatGPT can be one of them.

 Users have reported that a VPN connection stopped their app from working, and disconnecting immediately caused the problem to cease. You can always turn your VPN connection back on after you're done using the app, as disconnecting and connecting is as easy as a single tap from the Settings menu or third-party VPN app.

## 5\. Update the ChatGPT App

 As is the case with every device, app, and item, an update can do wonders to fix inexplicable issues. They're usually released to implement bug fixes and resolve issues, so you're likely to find a fix there. To check if an update is available, follow these steps:

1. Open the**App Store** .
2. Search for**ChatGPT** and open the app description.
3. The blue button will say**UPDATE** if one is available and**OPEN** otherwise.

![search for ChatGPT app in app store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/search-for-chatgpt-app-in-app-store.jpg)

Close

 You can also check for an update by tapping your profile icon (at the top-right corner) on the App Store.

## 6\. Uninstall and Reinstall the ChatGPT App

 If you've tried all the troubleshooting solutions above and still can't pinpoint the exact problem or work out an effective solution, your best bet is to move ahead with a fresh start. Delete your ChatGPT app from your iPhone, open the App Store, and try downloading it again.

To delete an app from your iPhone, follow these steps:

1. Long-press on the app.
2. Tap on the**minus sign** that appears on the app and select**Delete App** .
3. Confirm by pressing**Delete** again.

![press and hold apps to delete](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/press-and-hold-apps-to-delete.jpg)

![confirm deleting ChatGPT app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/confirm-deleting-chatgpt-app.jpg)

Close

 Download the app again by pressing the blue cloud icon next to the app's name in the App Store, and you'll be good to go.
