 AirDrop makes it easy to transfer data from one Apple device to another. But it's far from perfect, so you may occasionally face issues initiating or finishing an AirDrop transfer. Below, we list some troubleshooting steps to help you fix these problems.

## 1\. Change Your AirDrop Visibility Settings

 AirDrop gives you three visibility options:**Everyone** ,**Contacts Only** , or**Receiving Off** . If your device isn't showing up on AirDrop, it might be on**Receiving Off** . Therefore, switch to**Everyone** or**Contacts Only** , depending on the recipient.

[Open**Control Center** on your iPhone or iPad](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-customize-control-center-iphone/) , then tap and hold in the top-left section to reveal an**AirDrop** button. Choose your preferred option.

Close

 On a Mac, open**Control Center** and click**AirDrop** from the top-left section. In the window that pops up, choose**Everyone** or**Contacts Only** .

## 2\. Prepare Both Devices to Receive an AirDrop Request

 Your device can't be discovered if it's locked and in sleep mode. You must prepare your device for incoming AirDrop transfers, making it more likely to show up on someone else's device without delay.

 Unlock your iPhone or iPad and leave it on the Home Screen to prepare it. On a Mac, open a new**Finder** window and select**Go > AirDrop** from the menu bar to prepare for an AirDrop request.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![go tab in mac finder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/go-tab-in-mac-finder.jpg)

## 3\. Turn Off AirDrop Restrictions

 If AirDrop isn't showing up at all, you may have blocked it in your**Content & Privacy Restrictions** for Screen Time. On an iPhone or iPad, go to **Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

![allowed apps in iphone content and privacy restriction settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/allowed-apps-in-iphone-content-and-privacy-restriction-settings.JPEG)

Close

 On a Mac, go to **System Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy > App Restrictions** .

![content and privacy settings on mac](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/content-and-privacy-settings-on-mac.jpg)

 Make sure**AirDrop** is turned on for each device. You may need to enter your Screen Time passcode to make these changes.

## 4\. Enable AirDrop Over Cellular

 AirDrop's (Bluetooth) range is around 30 feet, so if you move beyond that distance, AirDrop won't work anymore. But if you've updated your device to iOS/iPadOS 17.1 (or later), you can enable a setting to allow AirDrop file transfers to continue even after you leave the range.

 On your iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > General > AirDrop** and toggle on**Use Cellular Data** to ensure transfers occur over LTE or 5G.

## 5\. Allow Sharing by Bringing Devices Together

 This particular fix is specific to NameDrop, a feature Apple introduced alongside iOS 17\. You can [use NameDrop to share contact information](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-contacts-namedrop-iphone/) by placing the top edge of two iPhones close to each other.

 If NameDrop isn't working, check if your device has the right settings. On your iPhone, go to**Settings > General > AirDrop** and toggle on**Bringing Devices Together** if you haven't.

 Note that NameDrop only lets you share new contact information. You can't update an existing contact with NameDrop.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Turn Off Do Not Disturb Mode

 Your device may not receive transfer requests from AirDrop if Do Not Disturb or another Focus mode is enabled. Open**Control Center** and hit the**Focus** icon (the default is a**moon** icon) to turn it off on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

![Control Center on Mac](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Control-Center-on-Mac.jpg)

## 7\. Restart Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on Both Devices

 A particularly useful solution if AirDrop isn't working is to disable and re-enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Open**Control Center** on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and hit the**Wi-Fi** and**Bluetooth** icons to turn them off, then select them again to turn them back on.

## 8\. Use AirDrop From a Third Apple Device

 This isn't an option for everyone, but if you have a spare Apple device, you should try using that to connect over AirDrop. Usually, if your iPhone, iPad, or Mac shows up on this new device, it will suddenly appear on the original device as well.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 9\. Send a Single File Instead of Multiple Files

 AirDrop lets you share many kinds of files at the same time. But if AirDrop isn't working, you should consider simplifying matters by sending a single file at a time instead.

 AirDrop files automatically open in a relevant app. For instance, images open in the Photos app, but multiple file types don't always open in the same app. This could explain why your AirDrop transfer failed.

## 10\. Check the Downloads Folder for Missing Files

 If AirDrop sent a file to your device but you can't find it, take a look in the Downloads folder. On an iPhone, open the**Files** app and select the**Browse** tab from the bottom. Then, head into**iCloud Drive** or**On My iPhone** and tap into the**Downloads** folder.

![browse tab in iphone files app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/browse-tab-in-iphone-files-app.JPEG)

![on my iphone folder in files app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/on-my-iphone-folder-in-files-app.JPEG)

Close

 On a Mac, you can usually find the**Downloads** folder by opening a new Finder window and pressing**Option + Command + L** . You may also find it next to**Trash** on your**Dock** .

## 11\. Turn Off Your VPN for AirDrop to Work

 Some users found that AirDrop didn't work until they [turned off the VPN on their iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-vpn-on-iphone/) or Mac. You might need to do this in the VPN app or your device settings.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > VPN** to do this. On a Mac, go to**System Settings > Network > VPN** .

## 12\. Open Your Mac's Firewall to More Connections

 The firewall on your Mac might be set to block all incoming connections, which often includes new AirDrop transfers. You'll need to loosen these restrictions from System Settings if AirDrop still isn't working.

 Go to**System Settings > Network > Firewall** . Toggle off**Firewall** and enter your Mac's admin password if prompted.

## 13\. Sign In to Your Apple ID Account Again

 Go to**Settings** or**System Settings** on your iPhone or Mac respectively, then select**\[Your Name\]** at the top of the menu and choose**Sign Out** at the bottom of the following page. Choose the data to keep on your device, then confirm you want to sign out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![apple id on mac](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/apple-id-on-mac.jpg)

 It doesn't matter too much if you keep data on your device since you're planning to sign in to the same account again. After signing out, return to**Settings** or**System Settings** to sign in to your Apple ID again.

## 14\. Update the Operating System

 Apple frequently releases iOS, iPadOS, and macOS updates to not only add new features but also fix software bugs and address security issues. If AirDrop still isn't working, install the latest updates for your devices to hopefully fix it.

 On an iPhone or iPad, go to**Settings > General > Software Update** . On a Mac, go to**System Settings > General > Software Update** to check for a newer version.

## 15\. Restart Both Devices

 This is a classic troubleshooting tip because it's so effective.[Restarting your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) , iPad, or Mac might be all you need to get AirDrop working again. And it only takes a moment to try it.

## 16\. Reset the Network Settings on Your Device

 You can reset the network settings on an iPhone or iPad to fix all kinds of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth problems, including issues with getting AirDrop to work. When you reset these settings, your device forgets any Wi-Fi passwords you've saved, so you'll have to manually reconnect to trusted networks again.

 If you still want to go ahead with it, go to **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset \[Device\] > Reset** and tap**Reset Network Settings** . Enter your passcode, then confirm you want to**Reset Network Settings** .

![iphone general settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/iphone-reset.JPEG)

![reset iphone settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/iphone-reset-settings.JPEG)

Close

 Unfortunately, macOS doesn't have a similar reset network option, so you'll have to follow a different set of instructions to [reset the network settings on your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/mac-network-settings-how-to-reset/) .

 We hope the above troubleshooting steps allowed you to use AirDrop and NameDrop again. If the problem persists, it's best to contact Apple Support for further assistance.

 In general, to get the feature to work, you only need to make sure you've enabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on your devices and have the right settings so that both devices can detect each other.
