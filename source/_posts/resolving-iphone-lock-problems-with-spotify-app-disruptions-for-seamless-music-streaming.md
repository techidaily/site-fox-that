## Resolving iPhone Lock Problems with Spotify App Disruptions for Seamless Music Streaming

 If you’re having trouble with Spotify on iOS 15, you aren’t alone. Since the latest iPhone update, some users have reported that Spotify crashes when they lock your phone. This means that in order to listen to music or podcasts, you need to keep your phone unlocked.

 This seems to be some sort of power-saving glitch, or potentially a bad interaction between the Spotify app and the latest version of iOS. Either way, this guide will show you the potential solutions to fix this problem.

## 1\. Delete the Cache

 Some users reported that simply deleting the Spotify cache fixes the issue right away, without having to do any additional fixes. Before you try anything else, give this a chance and see if it works.

 From the**Spotify** homepage, go to**Settings > Storage** and tap**Delete Cache** .

If this doesn’t work, proceed to the next fix.

## 2\. Delete Downloaded Podcasts and Songs

 The users who first reported this issue were podcast listeners, and they seem to face it more than anybody else. There is a reason for this—the issue happens when you frequently download podcasts or songs for offline listening. If you don’t clear these up, the issue is more likely to happen to you, and podcast fans are more likely to download new content as each new episode comes out.

 You can clear up all downloaded data by going to your**Spotify** app, tapping on**My Library** , and tapping on the**Downloaded** tab. Here, you can see all of your downloaded podcasts or songs, and you can delete the ones you’ve already listened to.

In most cases, this fixes the issue.

 If the first fix doesn’t work, you will need to delete the app and reinstall Spotify. This seems to fix the issue for everybody. You can do this the traditional way, but some users say that it works better to go to**Settings** \>**General** \>**iPhone Storage** \>**Spotify** and tapping**Offload App** and then deleting the app from there.

Then, you just need to reinstall Spotify and you’re good to go.

## Preventing Future Spotify Issues

 This issue, while easy to fix, can be annoying if you’re driving, as you’ll need to pull over to fix it. To prevent this issue from happening again, be sure to delete downloaded songs and podcasts frequently.

 You can also make Spotify auto-delete podcasts once episodes have been played! From the**Your Episodes** page, tap the gear icon and tap**Remove played episodes** . Here, you can set them to be automatically removed.

 That way you can forget about deleting them yourself without needing to worry about Spotify not working with iOS again.
