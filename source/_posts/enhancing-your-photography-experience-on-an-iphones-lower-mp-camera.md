## Enhancing Your Photography Experience on an iPhone's Lower MP Camera

 By default, your iPhone takes 12MP photos (or 24MP on the iPhone 15 series). However, some settings could lower that number, and you could have enabled them without knowing. So, read on to discover how to fix this issue.

## Adjust the Camera's Aspect Ratio

 If you know [what aspect ratio is in photography](https://www.makeuseof.com/aspect-ratios-in-photography-guide/) , then you most likely don't need this guide. Simply put, the aspect ratio is essentially the ratio of the width to the height of an image.

 The default aspect ratio on the iPhone is 4:3 since the camera sensor is 4:3\. If you've set the aspect ratio to anything else, your iPhone will use only part of its sensor, which leads to lower details and, therefore, lower megapixels. So, here's how to change your iPhone camera's aspect ratio:

1. Open the built-in Camera app on your iPhone, and make sure your phone is in**Photo** mode.
2. Swipe up in Photo mode to reveal the camera options.
3. Tap where it says**16:9** or**1:1** . Then, select**4:3** from the available options.

 If your aspect ratio returns to 16:9 or 1:1 upon relaunching the Camera app, you can fix it in**Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings** . Toggle**Creative Controls** off, and your aspect ratio should return to the default every time you relaunch it.

## Shoot in a Pro Format

 The iPhone 14 Pro and 15 Pro models can deliver the best possible image resolution when you shoot in a Pro format. But since it's not enabled by default, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Go to**Settings > Camera** and tap on**Formats** .
2. Make sure**Photo Mode** is set to**24MP** .
3. Toggle on**ProRAW & Resolution Control** .
4. Tap**Pro Default** and choose**HEIF Max** or**ProRAW Max** .

## Enjoy Better Quality Pictures on Your iPhone

 While resolution and megapixels aren't the only things you need to make a good photo, they certainly offer the minimum standard for quality. With higher megapixels, you have a photo that you can do more things with and manipulate without losing too much quality.
