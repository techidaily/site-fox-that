## Mastering Your iPhone 12: A Step-by-Step Guide to Resolving Its Top Twelve Obstacles

 Owners of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are generally quite happy with the device. From camera results to intensive gaming and processing, the overall performance of this device makes it worth a shot.

 However, you may experience some issues with iPhone 12 at some point in life. Fortunately, most of these issues are fixable. So, before you consider investing in a new phone, let's dig deeper into the biggest iPhone 12 issues and see how to fix them.

## 1\. No SIM or Invalid SIM Error on iPhone 12

 Thanks to Wi-Fi, many people forget the existence of SIM cards. What's the point of dialing from your phone if you are getting facilities to call and message people without extra charges?

 You might not notice that your iPhone has lost the SIM connection until it's actually needed. iPhone 12 might lose its connection to a SIM card due to a glitch in an update, a damaged SIM or port, improper tray placement, or a malfunction in the iOS system.

Before taking it to the nearest Apple Store, try these steps:

![Airplane mode on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-on-iPhone-1.JPG)

![Airplane mode off](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-off-1.JPG)

Close

1. Confirm that your SIM card is active and ready to use.
2. Activate Airplane Mode on the phone and turn it off. Your iPhone 12 should start catching signals.
3. If enabling/disabling Airplane Mode doesn't fix your problem, turn off the phone and take out your SIM tray.
4. Examine your SIM to confirm if there's any damage or not.
5. Put the SIM with the SIM tray back in the phone.
6. Restart your iPhone 12\. It should show mobile signals now.

 You may need to update iOS if the above method doesn't work. You can do so by going to**Settings > General > Software Update** on your iPhone. But if that doesn't solve the issue either, replace the SIM or get it inserted by a professional.

## 2\. Problems With Face ID on iPhone 12

 iPhone 12 is one of the newer models that support Apple's face recognition system. It is an additional security step that lets you unlock the phone and authorize different transactions on the device.

 Users might experience issues because of improper lighting or objects near the face when [setting up Face ID on the iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/set-up-face-id-on-iphone-ipad/) . If you cannot unlock your phone, clean the sensors (or the entire screen) with a soft microfiber cloth.

 You can also reset your Face ID. To do that, follow these simple instructions:

![Face ID in iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Face-ID-in-iPhone.JPG)

![Enter passcode on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Enter-passcode-on-iPhone.JPG)

![Face ID settings in iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Face-ID-settings-in-iPhone.JPG)

![Reset Face ID](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Reset-Face-ID.JPG)

Close

1. Go to**Settings** and scroll down until you see**Face ID & Passcode** .
2. Enter your passcode and toggle any disabled tabs mentioned under the**Use Face ID** section.
3. If that doesn't work, tap**Reset Face ID** and**Setup Face ID** .
4. Adjust the**Attention Awareness** features as desired. Enabling them adds an extra security layer and does not unlock the phone unless you are facing the screen.

 Usually, it is just a permission-related issue, but you have the option to reset it if needed.

## 3\. iPhone 12 Audio Issues

 Some iPhone 12 users might come across audio issues. Remember that it's a temporary problem and super easy to fix within a couple of steps. Press the**Ringer** button (left of the iPhone above the Volume buttons) upwards to activate sounds.

 If it still doesn't work, turn off Bluetooth on both devices and turn it back on. Also, make sure both devices are visible and available for pairing. If the problem persists, you should get your device checked.

## 5\. Wi-Fi Connection Problems With iPhone 12

 Using your iPhone without a stable Wi-Fi connection is a bit challenging. A poor connection or out-of-range Wi-Fi might be the top reasons your phone isn't connecting to the network. Apart from this, limited data plans or router issues may also lead to connectivity concerns.

2. Go to Settings and tap on**Wi-Fi** .

* Checking if the router is powered on and working smoothly. You can restart it if needed.
* Connecting your iPhone 12 to any other available Wi-Fi network.
* Contacting your internet service provider if nothing seems to work.

## 9\. Discoloration of the iPhone's Body

![Different iPhone color variants](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Different-iPhone-color-variants.jpg)

 The exciting part about iPhone 12 is its color variants. You get several options from red to blue, green, standard black, and many more. However, some users might see discoloration, despite taking relevant measures.

 Exposure to sunlight, poor-quality cover, and water contact are the leading causes of discoloration. If your iPhone 12 is discolored but is still under warranty,[book a Genius Bar appointment](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-store-appointment-genius-bar/) and get professional support from Apple.

## 10\. iTunes and App Store Problems

 Both the iTunes Store and App Store can sometimes have trouble functioning properly on iPhones, including the iPhone 12\. This can be due to outdated iOS, weak internet connection, or app glitches. Consider the following steps to restore your connection with Apple's servers:

1. Confirm with [Apple's System Status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) to check whether the issue is on your end or not.
2. Change your internet connection to a faster/more stable one.
3. Restart your iPhone, update iOS (if available), and then try relaunching the iTunes Store app or App Store.

 Regardless of the cause, you may be unable to use certain features like flash or even charge the iPhone when it overheats. An infrequent heat-up is considered normal, and you can avoid that by placing your iPhone 12 under a shade.

 However, consistent heating might mean a severe issue waiting to be addressed.
