## Restoring iPhone Functionality: No Button Access Needed – Learn How Here

 Whenever you face any issue with your iPhone, tech support and help articles almost certainly ask you to restart your device, which involves turning off your iPhone and switching it back on. Restarting an iPhone clears the unnecessary cache and fixes temporary glitches, ensuring a smooth experience.

 The steps to restart iPhones are simple but vary according to the different sets of models. This guide shows you how you can restart any iPhone. It even shows you how to restart an iPhone if the buttons are broken and not working.

## How to Restart an iPhone if the Buttons Are Broken or Not Working

 In the sections above, we detailed the steps to restart an iPhone using its physical buttons. However, there are two more methods you can use to restart your iPhone, and they don't involve using any buttons.

 This comes in handy if your iPhone buttons are broken or not working for any reason. It can also be helpful if you're unable to press and hold the buttons.

## How Often Should You Restart Your iPhone?

 The opinion on this varies from person to person. Some people don't restart their devices for weeks, while others frequently restart them. Most users perform a restart when their [iPhone feels slow](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-slow-iphone/) , their [iPhone apps keep crashing](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-ios-apps-keep-crashing-try-fixes/) , and the overall performance feels sluggish.

 For the best iPhone experience, you should restart your iPhone at least once every week. If you do it every three days, that's even better. This gives the device a chance to shut down and cool off. Plus, temporary files are cleared, minor issues are fixed automatically, and you'll probably face fewer situations where you need to [force stop apps on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-force-stop-apps-on-your-phone/) .

## Force Restart When a Normal Restart Doesn't Work

 This is how you can restart any iPhone. As you saw, the process is quick and straightforward. However, if your device is frozen, the screen is black, stuck indefinitely on the Apple logo, or the touch screen isn't working, a simple restart may not work.

 In these situations, consider force restarting your iPhone. The steps to force restart are different but still easy. Doing this may help fix your iPhone and get out of any ongoing trouble.
