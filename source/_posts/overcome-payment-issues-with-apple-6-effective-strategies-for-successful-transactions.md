## Overcome Payment Issues with Apple: 6 Effective Strategies for Successful Transactions

 Picture this: You're going about your day when you receive an email from Apple saying it declined the payment option attached to your subscription service. You're prompted to update your payment method to continue enjoying the service, but you weren't aware your card needed updating.

 Or perhaps you want to add a payment method to your Apple ID, but it gets declined. What do you do in either situation? Below, we'll list a few steps you can take when Apple declines your payment method.

## 1\. Check Your Payment Information

 When Apple declines your payment method, the first thing to try is to check your payment information to ensure it's accurate and up-to-date. If your billing details, such as your address or ZIP code, is incorrect, this can cause your payment method to be declined.

 If your current payment method has expired, you must renew your credit card and update your payment information or add a new payment method.

To check your payment information on an iPhone or iPad:

1. Go to**Settings** , then tap your**Apple ID name** at the top.
2. Tap on**Payment & Shipping** , then under**Payment Methods** , select your credit card.
3. Check your card number, expiry date, CVV, and billing information. If you notice any discrepancies, update them.
4. Tap**Done** in the top-right corner.

Close

To check your payment information on a Mac:

1. Launch the App Store app and click your name in the bottom left corner.
2. Now, click on**Account** **Settings** and sign in with your Apple ID if required.
3. Under**Apple ID Summary** , click on**Manage Payments** .
4. Click on**Edit** beside your payment method, then check your payment information and fix inaccuracies if you notice any.
5. Click**Done** in the bottom-right corner to save your changes.

## 2\. Try a Different Payment Method

 If Apple still declines your payment method, try a different payment method. You can add a new card to your Apple ID and see if it works.

 Besides cards, you can try alternative payment methods like [your Apple Account balance](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-funds-to-apple-account-balance/) ,[an Apple Gift Card](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-gift-card-vs-app-store-gift-card-vs-apple-store-gift-card/) , a debit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay, depending on whether or not they're valid in your country or region.

 Check [Apple's Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202631) to see what payment methods you can use with your Apple ID.

## 3\. Sign Out and Sign Back In

 Sometimes, a simple sign-out is all you need to fix payment issues on your device. If your payment method is declined in the App Store, you can sign out and sign back in to see if it fixes the issue.

## 5\. Contact Your Bank or Credit Card Company

 If you have sufficient funds in your bank account and your payment information is accurate, but you still can't add or use your payment method, contact your bank or credit card company. They should be able to explain the issue and help you resolve it.

## 6\. Contact Apple Support

 If all else fails, contact Apple Support as soon as possible. You can visit [Apple's Get Support site](https://getsupport.apple.com/) to explain your problem. An expert technician should be able to assist you with your payment method problem.
