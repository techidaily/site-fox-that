## Top 12 Common Problems with iPhone 12: Solutions & Workarounds

 Owners of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are generally quite happy with the device. From camera results to intensive gaming and processing, the overall performance of this device makes it worth a shot.

 However, you may experience some issues with iPhone 12 at some point in life. Fortunately, most of these issues are fixable. So, before you consider investing in a new phone, let's dig deeper into the biggest iPhone 12 issues and see how to fix them.

## 1\. No SIM or Invalid SIM Error on iPhone 12

 Thanks to Wi-Fi, many people forget the existence of SIM cards. What's the point of dialing from your phone if you are getting facilities to call and message people without extra charges?

 You might not notice that your iPhone has lost the SIM connection until it's actually needed. iPhone 12 might lose its connection to a SIM card due to a glitch in an update, a damaged SIM or port, improper tray placement, or a malfunction in the iOS system.

Before taking it to the nearest Apple Store, try these steps:

![Airplane mode on iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-on-iPhone-1.JPG)

![Airplane mode off](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Airplane-mode-off-1.JPG)

Close

1. Confirm that your SIM card is active and ready to use.
2. Activate Airplane Mode on the phone and turn it off. Your iPhone 12 should start catching signals.
3. If enabling/disabling Airplane Mode doesn't fix your problem, turn off the phone and take out your SIM tray.
4. Examine your SIM to confirm if there's any damage or not.
5. Put the SIM with the SIM tray back in the phone.
6. Restart your iPhone 12\. It should show mobile signals now.

 You may need to update iOS if the above method doesn't work. You can do so by going to**Settings > General > Software Update** on your iPhone. But if that doesn't solve the issue either, replace the SIM or get it inserted by a professional.

![Update iPhone to the latest OS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Update-iPhone-to-the-latest-OS-1.JPG)

Close

 If none of the steps seem to work, your SIM port is probably busted and might need repair by a professional.

## 2\. Problems With Face ID on iPhone 12

 iPhone 12 is one of the newer models that support Apple's face recognition system. It is an additional security step that lets you unlock the phone and authorize different transactions on the device.

![Different iPhone color variants](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Different-iPhone-color-variants.jpg)

 The exciting part about iPhone 12 is its color variants. You get several options from red to blue, green, standard black, and many more. However, some users might see discoloration, despite taking relevant measures.

 Exposure to sunlight, poor-quality cover, and water contact are the leading causes of discoloration. If your iPhone 12 is discolored but is still under warranty,[book a Genius Bar appointment](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-store-appointment-genius-bar/) and get professional support from Apple.

## 10\. iTunes and App Store Problems

 Both the iTunes Store and App Store can sometimes have trouble functioning properly on iPhones, including the iPhone 12\. This can be due to outdated iOS, weak internet connection, or app glitches. Consider the following steps to restore your connection with Apple's servers:

1. Confirm with [Apple's System Status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) to check whether the issue is on your end or not.
2. Change your internet connection to a faster/more stable one.
3. Restart your iPhone, update iOS (if available), and then try relaunching the iTunes Store app or App Store.

 If that doesn't help, you should browse relevant forums on Reddit to see if others are facing similar issues or start a discussion in [Apple Support Community](https://discussions.apple.com/welcome) .

## 11\. Fast Battery Drainage on the iPhone 12

![iPhone 13 MagSafe charging](https://thmb.techidaily.com/1f2f4c22410ca8169af4ae6d02cdc0eba714608bc6ab4df470b116ebdad1c1fb.jpg)

 Over time and constant use, the battery inside your iPhone 12 may start to deteriorate, and that's just unstoppable. However, excessive usage might lead to faster battery drainage. So, change your iPhone charger if you feel your phone isn't holding up the charge as before, especially if you use a third-party one.

 You can also contact the nearest Apple store and book an appointment for a battery replacement that'll set you back at $69, no matter which iPhone 12 model you have. Users also get guidance on efficient battery consumption by booking a Genius Bar reservation.
