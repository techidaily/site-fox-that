### Restart the iPhone

 The simplest method is to go to**Settings > General > Shut Down** . Then, press and hold the**Side** or**Top** button to restart the iPhone.

### Check the Date and Time

 An incorrect date or time can create issues with location sharing. To check this, go to**Settings > General > Date & Time** . If the date or time is wrong, turn on the switch next to**Set Automatically** to get the correct date and time from Apple's servers. If this doesn't help, deactivate the switch and set the correct time manually.

### Switch to Cellular Data

 Spotty Wi-Fi can also play a factor, so try using cellular or mobile data instead. To do that, open the iPhone's**Control Center** (swipe down from the top-right of the screen or swipe up from the bottom if your iPhone has a Home button) and tap the**Wi-Fi** icon to disable it.

 If cellular data is active, the iPhone should automatically start using it. If not, tap the**Cellular** icon to activate it. Just make sure you don't have any [cellular data problems on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-cellular-data-not-working-fixes/) as well.
