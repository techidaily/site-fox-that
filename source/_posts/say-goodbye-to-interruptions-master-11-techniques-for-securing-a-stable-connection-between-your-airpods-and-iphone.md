## 1\. Re-Establish the Connection With Your iPhone

 If your AirPods started disconnecting from your iPhone just a moment ago, then re-establishing the connection between both devices can help.

![Reconnect AirPods to iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-reconnect-airpods-e1619179489556.jpg)

 Just put your AirPods or AirPods Max in the charging case or Smart Case, wait for a few seconds, and then take them out again to reconnect them.

## 2\. Keep Your AirPods and iPhone Closer Together

 This one's probably obvious, but the further you move away from your iPhone, the higher the chances are that your AirPods won't stay connected. Keep the distance between you and your paired device under 30 feet, and you should be fine.

## 3\. Disable and Re-Activate Bluetooth on Your iPhone

 Disabling and re-activating Bluetooth on your iPhone or other connected device can eliminate minor technical glitches and help fix AirPods-related connectivity issues. The best way to do that is to toggle Airplane Mode on and off.

 Simply swipe down from the top-right of the iPhone's screen to open the Control Center (or swipe up from the bottom of the screen if the device has a Home button). Then, tap the**Airplane Mode** icon, wait for 10 seconds, and then tap it again to turn Bluetooth back on.

## 4\. Charge Your AirPods

 Your AirPods may randomly disconnect and have trouble staying connected to your iPhone when the batteries are low. Therefore, simply place your AirPods back in the case and charge them sufficiently before using them again.

 If the batteries of your AirPods often die quickly, you may want to review your usage habits to [prevent your AirPods' batteries from draining too fast](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-airpods-battery-dying/) .

## 5\. Disable Automatic Ear Detection

 Automatic Ear Detection is a feature that automatically detects when your AirPods are in your ears. But it can also cause the audio to disconnect, especially if you tend to fidget with the left or the right AirPod while wearing them. If your AirPods don't stay connected to your iPhone, turning off Automatic Ear Detection can help.

 First, connect your AirPods to your iPhone. Then, go to**Settings > Bluetooth** and tap the**i** icon next to your AirPods. Disable the**Automatic Ear Detection** option.

## 6\. Deactivate Automatic Switching

 Your [AirPods should automatically switch between Apple devices](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-airpods-not-switching-automatically/) when you start playing audio. While it's a convenient feature, if you have another iPhone, iPad, or Mac lying around, you might want to disable this functionality to avoid sudden disconnects.

 Go to**Settings > Bluetooth** and tap the**i** icon next to AirPods. Then, tap**Connect to This iPhone** and select**When Last Connected to This iPhone** . You must repeat that on each iOS and iPadOS device that you own.

## 7\. Avoid Wireless Interference

 Wireless interference can also prevent your AirPods from working correctly. Check whether you've got common sources of interference around youâ€”such as poorly shielded power cables, microwave ovens, wireless speakers, and so on. If so, you should move away from them.

## 8\. Update the Firmware on Your AirPods

## 10\. Reset Your AirPods

 To do this, put the AirPods in the charging case. Then, hold down the**Status** button (or both the**Noise Control** button and the**Digital Crown** on the AirPods Max) until the indicator flashes amber, then white.

 Now, take the AirPods out and follow the onscreen prompts on your iPhone to reconnect them.
