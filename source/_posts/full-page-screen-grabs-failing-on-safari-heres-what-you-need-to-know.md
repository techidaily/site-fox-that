## Full Page Screen Grabs Failing on Safari? Here's What You Need to Know

 Safari is a wonderful browser that allows you to browse the internet with minimal distractions. It even allows you to take full-page screenshots of webpages, documents, or emails that exceed your iPhone screen, allowing you to save these long files as a PDF.

 Unfortunately, full-page screenshots don't always work how they're supposed to. But we'll show you how to fix that below.

## How to Take a Full-Page Screenshot

 To take a full-page, scrolling screenshot of a webpage, take a screenshot as you normally would while on Safari, then tap the preview and select**Full Page** at the top. You can then choose**Save PDF to Files** or the Share icon to send it elsewhere.

## What to Do When Full-Page Screenshots Aren't Working

Try these tips if you can't take full-page screenshots in Safari.

### 1\. Check Your iOS Version

 Full-page screenshots are available for iPhone users running on iOS 13 and later. First, make sure that your iPhone is running an iOS version that supports the feature by going to**Settings > General > About** .

 If your OS is not the problem, make sure to check the app you’re using when attempting to take a full-page screenshot. It only works with Safari.

### 2\. Make Sure You're in Safari

 There are times that, depending on what you’re browsing, Safari will redirect you to another built-in app, like Apple Books, Files, or Messages. Full-page screenshots are not available in other apps or browsers.

Close

### 3\. Remove Safari From Any Home Screen Folders

 A recent update may have a bug where full-page screenshots aren't accessible if you open Safari from a folder.

 If your Safari is grouped with other apps in a folder on your Home Screen, first remove Safari from the folder and just place it somewhere on the Home Screen itself. Then launch the app and try to take a screenshot. You should see the Full-Page option again.

 However, if you don’t like a cluttered Home Screen, you can also launch Safari from the App Library.
