## What Can You Use Bluetooth For?

 Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows you to communicate or connect with various devices through radio waves. When your iPhone is within 33 feet of a connected Bluetooth device, you can use Bluetooth on your iPhone to transfer tons of files, images, and more between the two devices.

## How to Enable or Disable Bluetooth on an iPhone

 You can access the Bluetooth through the Control Center or through your iPhone’s settings. You can enable and disable Bluetooth in the iPhone’s Settings, while the Control Center will only allow you to enable it.

 If you do tap on the Bluetooth button in the Control Center to turn it off, it will disconnect your iPhone from paired devices and stop new Bluetooth connections. This happens even though Bluetooth is still enabled in Settings. We’ll describe both methods of enabling and disabling Bluetooth below.

Here’s how you can enable or disable Bluetooth from Settings:

1. Open**Settings** and go to**Bluetooth** .
2. Tap on the toggle next to**Bluetooth** to turn it on or off.

2. Tap on the Bluetooth icon to enable it or disconnect devices.

### 2\. Forget a Device and Pair It Again

 This is one of the most popular fixes out there. Select**Forget this Device** from your Bluetooth Settings, disable Bluetooth from devices, enable it again, and try pairing it as a completely new, unrecognized device. Oftentimes, a fresh start is all your iPhone needs to get its bearings.

### 3\. Pair the Bluetooth Device to Another iPhone

 This will rule out any defects in the device you’re trying to pair. If the problem persists while connecting with another iPhone, then there might be a Bluetooth issue in the device itself. You can also do this by attempting to connect your iPhone with another Bluetooth device instead to see if your phone is working.

### 4\. Reset the Network Settings

 When all else fails, or your Bluetooth problems get too frequent, you can reset the network settings by going to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.** This will wipe out all saved Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and VPN configurations on your iPhone. Just make all those connections again like you did when your phone was new.
