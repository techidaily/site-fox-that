## Avoid Frustration with These 15 Critical Repair Techniques for All Your iPhone Models

## 1\. Restart Your iPhone

 The number one cure for any tech ailment—iOS or Android, Windows or Mac, TV or printer—is to turn the device off and back on. Indeed, there are very few situations where a simple reboot shouldn't be your first port of call.

 The trick works because it resets the software into a stable state after an unexpected sequence of events caused something to break.

 The process varies depending on which model of iPhone you have, but we've covered [how to restart any iPhone, even if the buttons are broken](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) .

 iPhones generally have excellent battery life, even for power users. But if your device's battery drains unusually quickly, you can try to identify the offending app.

 To see which apps use the most juice, go to**Settings > Battery.** You can check the charts at the bottom to look at the battery usage of various apps over a certain time frame.

## 9\. Review Your iPhone's Battery Health

 Batteries can only tolerate a certain number of charge cycles before severely deteriorating. Fortunately, Apple allows you to keep an eye on your iPhone's battery health with ease.

 Go to**Settings > Battery > Battery Health and Charging** to take a look. And if it's lower than 80%, it's time to get a battery replacement.

## 10\. Fix Bluetooth Issues

 Bluetooth can act surprisingly finicky for a technology that's so widely used. If you're having problems creating a Bluetooth connection between your iPhone and another device, there are a couple of fixes you can try.

 Firstly, remove old devices that you no longer use. It can help avoid conflicts. To unpair a device, go to**Settings > Bluetooth > Info > Forget This Device** .

 Secondly, turn Bluetooth off and on again (sound familiar?). Swipe up from the bottom of the screen on an iPhone 8 or earlier (swipe down from the upper-right for iPhone X and later) to access the**Control Center** , and tap the**Bluetooth** icon to toggle it.

## 11\. Fix HomeKit Issues

 Some smart home devices are HomeKit-enabled, thus letting you control them from your iPhone using Siri.

 If your HomeKit devices are not working as expected, ensure you're logged into the same iCloud account on both your iPhone and the devices themselves. If nothing else works, you can reset your HomeKit connections by going to **Settings > Privacy & Security > HomeKit > Reset HomeKit Configuration** .

## 12\. Check for Dirt

![Cleaning an iPhone Charging Port with SIM Key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DSC01515.jpg)

 If you have [problems charging your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-wont-charge/) or using its physical buttons, you should always check for dirt, dust, and other muck that might have built up under the buttons and the Lightning port.

 The best way to dislodge the dirt at home is to use a can of compressed air. We have a [detailed guide on cleaning your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-iphone-guide/) that should help.

## 13\. Revoke Background Permissions

[If your iPhone overheats](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-ipad-getting-hot-heres-fix/) , you can't use features such as the camera flash. In extreme cases, you might not be able to use your phone at all until it cools down.

 Obviously, if you accidentally left your phone in the sun, it's easy to identify the culprit.[Car vent clips can also cause overheating](https://www.makeuseof.com/dangers-smartphone-car-vent-mount/) . However, if it overheats regularly during normal usage, an intensive background app could be at fault.

 To prevent apps from running in the background, go to**Settings > General > Background App Refresh** and slide the toggles on a per-app basis as required.

## 14\. Remove the SIM Card

 If you've suddenly lost the network signal unexpectedly, a dislodged SIM card could be your issue.

 Thankfully, it's easy to remove and reinsert the SIM. You just need a pin or paperclip to open the tray (because nobody keeps Apple's SIM-eject tool, right?).

## 15\. Go to an Apple Store

 If you can't fix the issue yourself, it's probably time to [book an Apple Store appointment at a Genius Bar](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-store-appointment-genius-bar/) . If your device is under warranty or you have Apple Care, the store will fix your iPhone for free, even if it involves sending it away for repair.

## iPhone 14 & 13 Troubleshooting Tips

 The iPhone 13 and 14 have one common issue related to 5G connectivity. There are also some [activation issues, among others, seen on the iPhone 13](https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-13-issues/) . Resetting the Network Settings has been shown to work in these cases.

 Some users have also reported [Face ID issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-face-id-not-working-or-not-available-on-iphone/) on the iPhone 14 Pro. Usually, all you need to do is clean your Face ID sensor or hold your iPhone correctly to get Face ID to unlock it.

## iPhone 12 Troubleshooting Tips

 Like the iPhone 14, the iPhone 12 also has some Face ID issues. However, one of the most common issues seen is a non-working SIM card.

 If you're facing issues on the iPhone 12, consider reading our guide on the [biggest iPhone 12 issues and how to fix them](https://www.makeuseof.com/iphone-12-issues/) .

## iPhone 11 Troubleshooting Tips

 More than anything, iPhone 11 users seem to have issues related to the battery. Either the battery drains too fast, or it has lost capacity too quickly.

 This can be a bothersome issue, as replacing an iPhone's battery can be pricey. With warranties usually expired for this model, users are left to fix it themselves.

 Before worrying too much, check out the battery health on your iPhone and see what capacity it's at. It might also be worth taking preventive [measures to protect your iPhone's battery health](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-maintain-your-iphones-battery-health/) .

## iPhone 8 Troubleshooting Tips

 The forced restart method changed on the iPhone 8\. If you own one, you'll need to press and release**Volume Up** , press and release**Volume Down** , then press and hold the**Side** button until you see the Apple logo.

 Another issue that afflicted a lot of iPhone 8 devices was a swelling battery. If you have this problem, you'll need to contact Apple for a replacement.

## iPhone 7 Troubleshooting Tips

 The most common iPhone 7 complaint is poor call quality. Apple has acknowledged the problem and offered a list of fixes. Here are the company's suggestions:

* Ensure your iPhone is not in Silent mode.
* Check if your phone's case is blocking the speaker.
* Restart your iPhone.
* Clean any dirt, dust, or debris out of the speaker.
* Make sure your speaker volume is set to the maximum.

 It's fair to say they're not particularly helpful suggestions, but that's Apple for you. Anecdotally, some users said Verizon was to blame, so you could try changing carriers if you're desperate.

## iPhone 6 Troubleshooting Tips

 A few people still use an iPhone 6\. It's the phone that was infamously "bendy." So, if you have one, be careful not to place it under physical stress.

 That aside, the iPhone 6 was probably the worst iPhone model from a design standpoint:

* It was found to pull people's hair out because of a tiny space between the screen and chassis (solution: don't hold it too close to your ear).
* Users suffered Error 53 messages if they replaced the Home button using a third party; it locked them out of their device.
* The Plus model's optical image stabilization system was defective.
* The touchscreen was prone to failure.

 Almost all these issues were only resolved by taking your phone to an Apple Store.

## Troubleshoot All Your iPhone Issues

 We've gone over fixes for the most common iPhone issues and even included tips for specific models. So, no matter which iPhone you have, there's something for you. Hopefully, one of these helps you fix your issue; you'll likely need to contact an Apple Support agent if not because they'll be able to assist you in more ways than we could.
