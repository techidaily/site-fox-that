 Sometimes, if your Voicemail box gets too full you'll stop receiving voicemails. While most modern iPhones have plenty of space, voicemail storage is limited and can fill up quickly, especially if you get a lot of spam calls.

 To delete previous voicemails and make more space, head to the**Phone** app and tap**Voicemail** . Once here, tap**Edit** in the top right-hand corner and select the voicemails you want to delete.

 Once selected, tap**Delete** in the bottom right-hand corner. Be sure to [back up your voicemails](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/back-up-iphone-voicemails/) if you might need them in the future. This will free up space, and you should be able to receive voicemails again if this was the issue.

 If you haven't set up voicemail yet, that could also be your problem. So,[set up voicemail on your iPhone](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-set-up-voicemail-on-the-iphone/) to avoid any more missed messages.

## 2\. Check for a Carrier Settings Update

 Not many people know this, but your carrier settings sometimes need updating. This doesn't happen often, but when it does, it means that updating it will fix many carrier problems. This includes not getting voicemails on your iPhone.

 Thankfully, updating your carrier settings is easy. Head to**Settings > General > About** to view your carrier settings. Wait for a few seconds; if your carrier requests an update, you'll get a pop-up to install a carrier settings update.

 It's important to note that you should be careful with your carrier settings. This page contains information that should be kept private to avoid it getting into the wrong hands. Only share this information with your carrier or Apple.

## 3\. Turn Cellular Service Off and On Again

 Sometimes, a quick reset of your cellular service can fix some voicemail issues. This is especially true if your voicemails aren't downloading fast enough. One good indicator of this is getting a voicemail notification hours after you received a missed call from the same number. To resolve this issue, turn your cellular service off and on again.

 You can do this by turning your phone off and on again, or you can put your phone in and out of airplane mode. Once you do this, check to see if your voicemail is working again by calling your phone from another device. If you received a voicemail, then this solved the problem.

 Additionally, we'd like to point out that connecting to Wi-Fi can also sometimes help you resolve this problem.

## 4\. Make Sure Cellular Data Is On

![cellular data on](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cellular-data-on.jpg)

 Cellular data is necessary for receiving voicemails in most cases. After all, voicemail is a carrier feature, and connecting to data ensures that your voicemails get delivered. Cellular data is also necessary for the Visual Voicemail feature to work. This is where you can read a voicemail without listening to it.

 If your voicemail isn't working and you don't have data turned on, enabling it could resolve the issue. Head to**Settings > Cellular** and tap**Cellular Data** to turn it on. If you're on a limited data plan, there are options to [reduce your iPhone's data usage](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/everything-can-cut-iphone-cellular-data-usage) and still receive voicemails.

## 5\. Enable Wi-Fi Calling

![wifi calling enable](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wifi-calling-enable.jpg)

 If you live in an area with a poor cellular connection, chances are your voicemails are taking a long time to download to your device. A poor connection can also lead to getting missed call notifications without your phone ringing.

 If this happens to you, you can resolve this by enabling [Wi-Fi calling on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/wi-fi-calling-iphone-guide/) . This gives you a better connection and helps voicemails download quicker. It also helps you get better audio quality and reduces dropped calls.

 To enable Wi-Fi calling, head to**Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling** . Once here, tap**Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone** to turn it on. This will enable Wi-Fi calling whenever you're connected to Wi-Fi. It costs nothing, so it's worth having it turned on 24/7.

## 6\. Make Sure Call Forwarding Is Off

 If you have Call Forwarding enabled, it means your calls are being directed to a different number. While disabled by default, sometimes it can accidentally get enabled if you're playing around with the settings. If it's enabled, this is why you aren't receiving voicemails.

 To disable it, head to**Settings > Phone > Call Forwarding** and toggle it off. Not all carriers have Call Forwarding enabled. So, if you don't see it in your iPhone settings, it means you don't have it, or your carrier has disabled it.

 This might be your issue if your iPhone is issued by your workplace, as many workplaces will set up Call Forwarding.

## 7\. Reset Network Settings

 If your iPhone's voicemail still isn't working after the previous fixes, there is a possibility that resetting the network settings will help. This also helps if you're having other issues with your network, like getting missed calls without your phone ringing or issues with mobile data.

 To reset the network settings, head to **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings** .

[Resetting your Network Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-iphone/) won't erase any content from your device.

## 8\. Make Sure Your iPhone Is Updated

 While the previous solutions usually fix voicemail on your iPhone, there are some instances where there might be a problem with the iOS. To fix this, you would just need to [update your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/) . This may be the solution if you've avoided updating for a while or have automatic updates off.

 To check for an update or confirm that you're on the latest iOS version available, head to**Settings > General > Software Update** . If you have an available update, you can download and install it from here.

## 9\. Access Your Voicemail the Old-Fashioned Way

 Visual Voicemail in the Phone app is great, but if it's not working, it's not the only way to check your voicemail. If you tried the above fixes and your iPhone's voicemail still doesn't work, you might need to check your voicemail the old-fashioned way for the time being.

 By calling your own number on your phone, you can check your voicemail through your carrier. To do this, dial your number, then enter your password and press the pound key. If you don't know your password, the default is usually the last four digits of your phone number.

 If you still can't gain access or are having voicemail issues here as well, you can contact your carrier and ask them to reset your voicemail password. You can also call them to check for any other issues.
