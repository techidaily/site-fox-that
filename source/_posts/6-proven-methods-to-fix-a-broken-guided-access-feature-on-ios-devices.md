## 6 Proven Methods to Fix a Broken Guided Access Feature on iOS Devices

 Guided Access limits the content a user can access on your device. It’s a handy iOS feature that helps to protect your privacy when, for example, you let your friend borrow your iPhone.

 So, what should you do if a person can still access other content on your iPhone, even after you enabled Guided Access? Or if your iPhone’s Guided Access triple-click is not working, and pressing the button just turns off your iPhone screen?

 Let’s look at the different solutions you can apply when your iPhone’s Guided Access is not working.

## 1\. Review Your Guided Access Settings

 Before assuming that Guided Access is not working because it’s faulty, it’s best to check the settings you have in place first. If you can still triple-click your**Home** or**Side** button to [enable Guided Access](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/guided-access-iphone/) , do so, then triple-click again to access**Options** to review your customized settings.

 For example, if**Touch** is toggled on, this is the reason why other people can explore the contents within your opened app. Toggle off**Touch** to solve the issue.

 If you don’t want users to type anything, toggle off**Software Keyboards** . To prevent a Guided Access session from ending automatically, toggle off**Time Limit** .

## 2\. Turn Off Guided Access and Turn It On Again

 If your Guided Access triple-click is not working, the first method probably isn’t applicable in your situation. In this case, you need to head to**Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access** . Toggle off**Guided Access** and toggle it on again.

 It’s that simple because the triple-click issue may just be a random glitch. Afterward, head to your desired app, triple-click your**Home** or**Side** button as usual, and Guided Access should start working again.

## 4\. Update Your iPhone

 If you only notice that Guided Access is not working after a recent iOS update, the issue may be caused by the update itself. Ironically, new updates may occasionally carry other unexpected bugs.

 Therefore, if you feel that Guided Access is an essential function—for example, you frequently [use Guided Access to limit your child's phone or tablet use](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-limit-kids-ipad-with-guided-access/) —you can opt to [roll back to an older version of iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-downgrade-ios/) to solve the issue.

## 6\. Reset All Settings on Your iPhone

 If your iPhone’s Guided Access is still not working, the last solution you can try is to reset all settings on your iPhone. Go to **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset All Settings** .

 The procedure restores all settings on your iPhone to the default state. As long as you follow the above instructions carefully and tap the correct buttons, rest assured that you won’t delete any data on your iPhone.
