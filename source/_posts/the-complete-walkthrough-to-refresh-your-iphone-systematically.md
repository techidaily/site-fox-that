 Take note that a soft reset also differs from a hard reset. When you hard reset or [factory reset your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-methods-factory-reset-iphone-without-password-ios-beta-16/) , the procedure erases your iPhone's data and restores your device to its blank, default state, as though you just bought it.

 You'll likely soft reset your iPhone when it's completely frozen. For example,[when your iPhone is stuck on the Apple logo](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-iphone-stuck-apple-logo/) . A soft reset does not erase any data.
