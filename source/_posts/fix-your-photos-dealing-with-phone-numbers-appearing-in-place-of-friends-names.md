## Fix Your Photos: Dealing with Phone Numbers Appearing in Place of Friends' Names

 You may have faced an issue on your iPhone where whenever you receive a message, the Messages app shows it as coming from a phone number instead of the saved contact name.

 This can be quite annoying, as you can't see who has actually tried messaging you, even if you've got their number saved on your phone.

 Fortunately, this is a common issue and can be easily fixed! We'll show you what to do below.

## Why Does Your Contact Name Disappear?

 When you initially see the Messages app showing a phone number instead of a contact name, you may think someone random has messaged you.

 This may look even weirder when you have a [conversation pinned to the top of your Messages](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-pin-conversations-apples-messages-app-iphone-mac/) screen for easier access, and that's the one showing a phone number.

 However, this is usually a temporary issue and should fix itself. If this isn't the case, you can try a few quick fixes to get things back to normal quickly.

## Restart Your iPhone

 A quick fix to getting your contact names back instead of phone numbers is to [restart your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/) . As with many other issues, a quick reboot usually does the trick, and you should be able to see your contact names instead of phone numbers in Messages.

 In the case that this doesn't work and you are still facing the same issue, follow the fixes below.

## Add or Remove the Country Code

 Sometimes the issue may be caused by Messages not associating phone numbers without a country code with their entries in your contact list. For example, the international dialing code for the UK is +44\. If Messages thought that +447981234532 was different from 07981234532, it would show the chat under a phone number.

 The solution to this is simple. Just add the country code to the phone numbers that are showing this behavior:

1. Open up**Contacts** on your iPhone, and select the person who's showing up incorrectly in Messages.
2. Tap**Edit** .
3. Add the country code to the start of their phone number, using either the full format (0044) or the short format (+44). Make sure you get the right country code for their device, which should be what shows up in the Messages app.
4. Click**Done** .

![Add Country Code to Number](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fix-Messages-Not-Showing-Contact-Number.jpg)

Close

 You'll have to do this directly from the Contacts app because Messages doesn't recognize the phone number as a contact and hence won't make the change.

 Alternatively, if you choose to add a new contact from the phone number, you can add it to an existing contact. But then you'll have two numbers saved for that person.

 Once you fix a phone number, you'll see Messages will automatically merge the conversations split across different chats.

## Toggle iCloud Contacts

 Some people have reported iCloud contacts being the reason behind this issue. If you are syncing your contacts with your iCloud account, it might be worth re-syncing them, which might fix the issue.

To do this, follow these steps on your iPhone:

1. Open up the**Settings** app.
2. Tap on**\[Your Name\] > iCloud** .
3. Click on**Show All** underneath the**Apps Using iCloud** section.
4. From the list, turn off**Contacts** .
5. When prompted what to do with the previously synced iCloud contacts on your device, choose**Delete** . Don't worry because they'll still be saved in iCloud.
6. Wait for a few seconds and then turn**Contacts** back on. When you are asked, select**Merge** . This will merge all your contacts with your phone's contacts.
7. Now, restart your device, and this should fix the issue.
