## How to Retrieve Lost Appointments From Your iOS Event Scheduler

 What happens if you have an important appointment saved in your iPhone's Calendar app, but when you search the calendar for the exact date and time, you can't find the appointment anymore?

 You might not be able to find any dates, whether past or present, even after using the search feature. Below, we look at some troubleshooting tips you can try when events are not showing up in the Calendar app.

## 1\. Ensure Your Calendar Is Syncing All Events

 If you're using a non-iCloud account on your phone, your Calendar may have trouble finding your past events. You might also face this problem if you created the event on a different device.

 The trick is to make sure you sync and show more than just the events that happened in the last few weeks or months. Here's how:

1. Open**Settings** , scroll down, and tap on**Calendar** .
2. Select**Sync** and choose**All Events** from the list of available options.
3. Now, wait for a minute and launch the Calendar app. Then, tap**Calendars** at the bottom and swipe down from the top to refresh all your calendars.

 If the**All Events** option is already selected, you can choose any of the other timeframes, restart the Calendar app, then select**All Events** again.​​​

## 2\. Ensure Your Calendar Is Syncing With iCloud

 If the Calendar app isn't showing your events, there's a decent chance the problem lies in your iCloud settings. You can [solve general iCloud sync issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/icloud-sync-problems-x-fixes-common-cloud-storage-issues) in other ways, but this is how to manually allow the Calendar app to sync your data:

1. Launch**Settings** on your iPhone and tap your**Apple ID name** at the top.
2. Next, tap on**iCloud** to view your iCloud settings.
3. You'll see an**Apps Using iCloud** section where you can toggle on iCloud for the**Calendar** app.
4. If you have multiple devices connected to the same iCloud account, you should toggle the**Calendar** option on each of them.

## 3\. Ensure All Your Calendars Are Enabled

 One of the nifty features of the Calendar app in iOS is the ability to set up several calendars for different purposes. You can set up a shared calendar that lets you and your partner schedule date nights, for example, while also making a work calendar that helps you organize your meetings.

 So, there's a chance your events are missing because they belong to a different group. You have to make sure all your calendars are enabled to prevent that. Here's how:

1. Launch the**Calendar** app and tap**Calendars** at the bottom of your screen.
2. Ensure you select the calendar groups that are important and are associated with the missing event.
3. Also, ensure you select**Show Declined Events** so any past events you didn't accept will appear in your search for the missing event.
